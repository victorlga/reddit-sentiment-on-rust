      "text": "Someone posted an AI generated Reddit post on r/rustjerk titled [Why Our CTO Banned Rust After One Rewrite](https://www.reddit.com/r/rustjerk/comments/1koe69y/why_our_cto_banned_rust_after_one_rewrite/?share_id=gEZ9ry4zpFIEQlU8xKvvN&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1). It's obviously a fake, but I have a story that bears resemblance to parts of the AI slop in relation to Rust's project success being its' death in a company. Also, I can't sleep, I'm on painkillers, after a surgery a few days ago, so I have some time to kill until I get sleepy again, so here it goes.\n\nA few years ago I've been working at a unicorn startup that was growing extremely fast during the pandemic. The main application was written in Ruby on Rails, and some video tooling was written in Node.js, but we didn't have any usage of a fast compiled language like Rust or Go. A few months after I joined we had to implement a real-time service that would allow us to get information who is online (ie. a green dot on a profile), and what the users are doing (for example: N users are viewing presentation X, M users is in are in a marketing booth etc). Not too complex, but with the expected growth we were aiming at 100k concurrent users to start with. Which again, is not \\*that\\* hard, but most of the people involved agreed Ruby is not the best choice for it.\n\nA discussion to choose the language started. The team tasked with writing the service chose Rust, but the management was not convinced, so they proposed they would write a few proof of concept services, one in a different language: Elixir, Rust, Ruby, and Node.js. I'm honestly not sure why Go wasn't included as I was on vacation at the time, and I think it could have been a viable choice. Anyways, after a week or so the proof of concepts were finished and we've benchmarked them. I was not on the team doing them, but I was involved with many performance and observability related tasks, so I was helping with benchmarking the solutions. The results were not surprising: Rust was the fastest, with the lowest memory footprint, then was Elixir, Node.js, and Ruby. With a caveat that the Node.js version would have to be eventually distributed cause of the single threaded runtime, which we were already maxing on a relatively small servers. Another interesting thing is that the Rust version had an issue caused by how the developer was using async futures sending messages to clients - it was looping through all of the clients to get the list of channels to send to, which was blocking the runtime for a few seconds under heavy load. Easy to fix, if you know what you're doing, but a beginner would get it right in Go or Elixir more likely than in Rust. Although maybe not a fair point cause other proof of concepts were all written by people with prior language experience, only the Rust PoC was written by a first-time Rust developer.\n\nAfter discussing the benchmarks, ergonomics of the languages, the fit in the company, and a few other things, the team chose Rust again. Another interesting thing - the person who wrote the Rust PoC was originally voting for Elixir as he had prior Elixir experience, but after the PoC he voted for Rust. In general, I think the big part of the reason why Rust has been chosen was also its' versatility. Not only the team viewed it as a good fit for networking and web services, but also we could have potentially used it for extending or sharing code between Node.js, Ruby, and eventually other languages we might end up with (like: at this point we knew there are talks about acquiring a startup written in Python). We were also discussing writing SDKs for our APIs in multiple langauges, which was another potentially interesting use case - write the core in Rust, add wrappers for Ruby, Python, Node.js etc.\n\nThe proof of concepts took a bit of time, so we were time pressed, and instead of the original plan of the team writing the service, I was asked to do that as I had prior Rust experience. I was working with the Rust PoC author, and I was doing my best to let him write as much code as possible, with frequent pair programming sessions.\n\nBecause of the time constraints I wanted to keep things as simple as possible, so I proposed a database-like solution. With a simple enough workload, managing 100k connections in Rust is not a big deal. For the MVP we also didn't need any advanced features: mainly ask if a user with a given id is online and where they are in the app. If user disconnects, it means they're offline. If the service dies, we restart it, and let the clients reconnect. Later on we were going to add events like \"user\\_online\" or \"user\\_entered\\_area\" etc, but that didn't sound like a big deal either. We would keep everything in memory for real-time usage, and push events to Kafka for later processing. So the service was essentially a WebSocket based API wrapping a few hash maps in memory.\n\nWe had a first version ready for production in two weeks. We deployed it after one or two weeks more, that we needed for the SRE team to prepare the infrastructure. Two servers with a failover - if the main server fails we switch all of the clients to the secondary. In the following month or so we've added a few more features and the service was running without any issues at expected loads of <100k users.\n\nUnfortunately, the plans within the company changed, and we've been asked to put the service into maintenance mode as the company didn't want to invest more into real time features. So we checked the alerting, instrumentation etc, left the service running, and grudgingly got back to our previous teams, and tasks. The service was running uninterrupted for the next few months. No errors, no bugs, nothing, a dream for the infrastructure team.\n\nAfter a few months the company was preparing for a big event with expected peak of 500k concurrent users. As me and the other author of the service were busy with other stuff, the company decided to hire 3 Rust developers to bring the Rust service up to expected performance. The new team got to benchmarking and they found a few bottlenecks. Outside the service. After a bit of kernel settings tweaking, changing the load balancer configuration etc. the service was able to handle 1M concurrent users with p99=10ms, and 2M concurrent users with p99=25ms or so. I don't remember the exact numbers, but it was in this ballpark, on a 64 core (or so) machine.\n\nThat's where the problems started. When the leadership made the decision to hire the Rust developers, the director responsible for the decision was in favour of expanding Rust usage, but when a company grows from 30 to 1000 people in a year, frequent reorgs, team changes, and title changes are inevitable. The new director, responsible for the project at the time it was evaluated for performance, was not happy with it. His biggest problem? If there was no additional work needed for the service, we had three engineers with nothing to do!\n\nNow, while that sounds like a potential problem, I've seen it as an opportunity. A few other teams were already interested in starting to use Rust for their code, with what I thought were legitimately good use cases for Rust usage, like for example processing events to gather analytics, or a real time notification service. I need to add, two out of the three Rust devs were very experienced, with background in fin-tech and distributed systems. So we've made a case for expanding Rust usage in the company. Unfortunately the director responsible for the decision was adamant. He didn't budge at all, and shortly after the discussion started he told the Rust devs to better learn Ruby or Node.js or start looking for a new job. A huge waste, in my opinion, as they all left not long after, but there was not much we could do.\n\nNow, to be absolutely fair, I understand some of the arguments behind the decision, like, for example, Rust being a relatively niche language at that time (2020 or so), and we had way more developers knowing Node.js and Ruby than Rust. But then there were also risks involved in banning Rust usage, like, what to do with the sole Rust service? With entire teams eager to try Rust for their services, and with 3 devs ready to help with the expansion, I know what would be my answer, but alas that never came to be.\n\nWhat's the funniest part of the story, and the part that resembles the main point of the AI slop article, is that if the Rust service wasn't as successful, the company would have probably kept the Rust team. If, let's say, they had to spend months on optimising the service, which was the case in a lot of the other services in the company, no one would have blinked an eye. Business as usual, that's just how things are. And then, eventually, new features were needed, but the Rust team never get that far (which was also an ongoing problem in the company - we need a feature X, it would be easiest to implement it in the Rust service, but the Rust service has no team... oh well, I guess we will hack around it with a sub-optimal solution that would take considerably more time and that would be considerably more complex than modifying the service in question).\n\nNow a small bonus, what happened after? Shortly after the decision about banning Rust for any new stuff, the decision was also made to rewrite the Rust service into Node.js in order to allow existing teams to maintain it. There was one attempt taken that failed. Now, to be completely fair, I am aware that it \\*is\\* possible to write such a service in Node.js. The problem is, though, a single Node.js process can't handle this kind of load cause of the runtime characteristics (single thread, with limited ability to offload tasks to service workers, which is simply not enough). Which also means, the architecture would have to be changed. No longer a single process, single server setup, but multiple processes synced through some kind of a service, database, or a queue. As far as I remember the person doing the rewrite decided to use a hosted service called Ably, to not have to handle WebSocket connections manually, but unfortunately after 2 months or so, it turned out the solution was not nearly performant enough. So again, I know it's doable, but due to the more complex architecture being required, not a simple as it was in Rust. So the Rust service was just running in production, being brought up mainly on occassions when there was a need to expand it, but without a team it was always ending up either abandoning new features or working around the fact that Rust service is unmaintained."

      "text": "Working in rust for 6 years\n\nThe biggest actual productivity problems I feel with the language are:\n\n1. It is hard to customize the behavior of foreign types to quickly solve a problem. The best approach is usually wrapper types but this can result in large refactors and cognitive overload as wrapper types proliferate.\n2. There are some weaknesses at language level around how you make extensible and powerful APIs without proliferation of user facing types. Most libraries use “builder pattern” to initialize things that are “complex”. But when generics and defaults get involved then the builder pattern can become extremely complex.\n\nThe biggest productivity problems I see in the ecosystem are:\n\n3. Many parts of the crates io ecosystem still have experimental feel, so often you may start a project and after a while decide to change to other libraries or framework. Within these libraries, community is still figuring out things like “how should errors work”, “how should we use async”. There’s a lot of churn over years and it can be hard for a new dev coming to an older project to navigate and make sense of all that.\n\n4. The error situation in particular is really unfortunate. std::error has been there for years but didn’t work on no std for a long time, and most of it was deprecated and redesigned at various points. Now there is big push to use it (and this error, anyhow, eyre, etc) but it still feels incomplete. Can an error not have multiple independent causes? Really guys? Can there not be n different reasons why a json object could not be deserialized? I usually avoid std error and all related stuff like the plague, it’s going to be years more before it is in a stable happy place and not a source of pain.\n\n5. For a lot of common needs, like “I need a throwaway web app, with simple auth and db”, there’s nothing as mature as Django or rails, or even close. For projects that are in between that and the “sweet spot” for rust, it’s hard to judge when using rust will help you more than slow you down. Most people working in rust are not thinking like “I wish this framework could autogenerate simple db migrations”, they are usually focused on much more low level issues. So the question “should I use rust for this” is always kinda complicated to answer."

Currently we're forced to reparse over and over again the same code slowing down compilation times. Most of the time, I just need to identify what entries a struct has and a few tags for each member! This should be easy to write and not require a full independent program.\n\nThe lack of inheritance with virtual functions makes the language kinda hard to sell in bigger teams, as it basically necessitates not only a full re-write but also a redesign of the architecture. As such, once you're on the >1M loc territory, the transition becomes intractable. This addition would be enough to currently push over some teams I know. I know that this feature as is implemented in C++ wouldn't fly, but I think that a better alternative to either a macro mess that is needed to implement an AST or just doing composition when clearly that is not the right intent would be ideal.\n\nThe lifetime of `self` cannot be easily split to its parts to make parts of it shared and parts of it mutable. This has caused in more than one occasion the need to pass all members of the struct as separate parameters so they could be treated individually. I know that treating this problem might require analysis over the hole set of member functions of a struct in order to identify how each function would need the self parameter to be split, and I know this would not match with my previous comment about inheritance as there explicitly you can't know all the member functions of a struct due to some being virtual.\n\nTraits are an objective downgrade compared to C++ templates, making you jump through tons of hoops to get anything done. I wish there was a proper generic function implementation. I do think that traits are amazing to represent interfaces though!\n\nThe async functionality, at least last time I tried it, was really, really clunky once you start wanting to use member functions and traits.

The borrow checker 2. Manual memory management. 3. Lots of libraries.\n\nJust depends on how I’m feeling. No manual memory management and borrow checkers means I can be relaxed in my designs and focus on expressing my self in logic vs keeping track of issues in the code. But I come to miss it especially in applications where allocation patterns and gc latency can be a significant factor. And plenty of libraries means you can do a lot easily but also, dependencies are scary. Dependencies need to be kept up to date for security reasons. Dependencies can change, become abandon, and disappear. And borrow checker ensure my massively multithreaded spaghetti code is memory access correct assuming you can read and modify it.\n\nThe compilation time doesnt affect me much. It’s fast enough to get most programs done and bigger programs take more time fits suitably in my mind. I want differential compilation updates to be fast and it is for me. And I don’t have the fastest computer in the world."

      "text": "Lots of good suggestions in this thread already for the pain points in Rust 🙂 Since you're looking for things to fix in your language, I wanted to give some \"food for thought\" on language design.\n\nDesigning a programming language is all about trade-offs! Rust even ended up with the \"bad\" points you listed above because it was about balancing trade-offs:\n\n1. Verbose syntax - Rust is a low-level language, so unlike e.g. Python, Rust tries to make it clear which parts of your program are expensive at the syntax level. Also, IIRC it was designed to be (somewhat) familiar for C++ developers.\n2. Slow compilation time - This is a huge pain point for me! But it came about because runtime performance and compile-time safety were a higher priority. I believe trait solving and monomorphization are two big pain points here: it'd be hard to get huge wins without reconsidering one of those first.\n3. Inefficient compatibility with C - C interop is  a very complicated topic (e.g. Zig handles this by using `libclang` internally, which is a pretty hefty dependency!). TL;DR for Rust is it's designed to be \"C-free\" at the language level, but exposes just enough features so interop can be handled at the library level (see: the `libc` and `bindgen` crates)\n\nMaybe this is obvious advice, but basically... if you're interested in fixing problems with Rust, it's _really_ important to think about what trade-offs you're willing to make. Or better yet, what kind of objectives / goals you have for your language, and which you're willing to drop from Rust's goals.\n\nFinally, instead of giving some bad parts about Rust, I'll twist it a bit and give a few possible major changes you could consider for a new Rust-like language. None of these are earth-shattering, but could lead to some interesting options when mixed with Rust's formula (I wouldn't consider these all together, it's more fun to think about them one-by-one):\n\n- Use a runtime\n    - Pros: greatly simplifies async, garbage collection, and probably lots of other features\n    - Cons: bad for systems programming (embedded devices, OSes, etc), bad for interop with other languages\n- Use reference counting and/or garbage collection instead of lifetimes / dropping\n    - Pros: easier to learn, more expressive\n    - Cons: slower at runtime, need to handle cleanup of other types of resources some other way (closing files and network connections, etc)\n- Don't use LLVM, and instead compile directly into another language (such as C)\n    - Pros: better interop, get portability \"for free\", re-use lots of good existing tooling, gives more flexibility to choose between fast runtime / fast compile time\n    - Cons: much harder to get good error messages / debug info, locks you in to problems with the underlying language somewhat\n- Use Lisp-like syntax\n    - Pros: more consistent, very easy to write a parser for, simplifies macros a ton\n    - Cons: less familiar for existing developers, harder for new programmers to transfer skills, can get noisy with lots of nesting"

It *feels* like it shouldn’t be too hard for the compiler to throw an error if I try to read any portion of it that hasn’t been initialized yet. And maybe that does happen, but I always end up having to initialize it to a default value before working with it anyway.\n\nThe thing that comes to mind most recently is that I had an array of 50 bools to check if a certain thing had happened in the last 50 ticks. The vast majority of times, the entire array would be filled. But it also doesn’t make sense to use a default value because no ticks have occurred. It also feels bad to split it into two types, one having option and one not, because it almost always doesn’t need that. \n\nThere are quite a few ergonomic holes like this in rut. I appreciate the safety the language provides and it’s certainly better than having no guardrails.

Or perhaps an automatic versioning tooling.\n\n1.a if version was easier, maybe std can be larger as you can now more comfortable have small breaking changes but keep interoperability.\n\n2.Type inference that doesn’t hold back evolution of the language, for example inference.lock file (Read this somewhere) \n\n3.Support interoperability with as different programming languages as much as possible with better ergonomics (Even if it cost performance) \n\n4.More static checks in the language and std\n\nE.g: A file that is open in read only and later calling write will fail in runtime\n\n5.Better deadlock detecting"

      "text": "Hey the creator of a now archived programming language! [https://github.com/wyst-lang/wyst/tree/legacy](https://github.com/wyst-lang/wyst/tree/legacy)\n\nfirst i'll mention my specific problems then i will explain how you can implement what other people mentioned.\n\n# Use Rust macros instead of making your own parser\n\nThis may seem a bit weird or will conflict with the **Slow Comp-time** Issue but in the end i think it might be worth it. In rust you can make macros that output code (but more importantly you can define your own syntax as the input). What you can do is define a recursive rust macro for parsing something like a function and output the rust code. and even better it offers code completions. **I can make a proof of concept**\n\n# LSP (language server)\n\nA language server is how your IDE can do it's fancy magic, like variable completions, goto, etc. Sadly making one (especially for a custom language) is hard. Tutorials and documentation exist, but you're on your own. A workaround to a LSP is **Using rust macros** instead of your own parser and the rust-analyzer does the rest for you.\n\n# Expandable structs\n\nIn some other languages, there are trait-like definitions but instead of functions it's struct fields. This can be plenty useful in modularity cases. here is an example in TypeScript\n\n    interface BaseType {\n      name: string;\n      age: number;\n    }\n    \n    interface ExtendedType extends BaseType {\n      email: string;\n    }\n    \n    // ExtendedType is equivalent to:\n    // {\n    //   name: string;\n    //   age: number;\n    //   email: string;\n    // }\n\nCurrently in rust this can only be done using attribute macros. The way you can implement it is by making a attribute macro that takes an argument (the `BaseType`) and extends `ExtendedType.`\n\n# Lifetime syntax\n\nWe can all agree on this one, In code generation, simply make the lifetime and add a phantom data to ensure that it's being \"used\", When you get a reference, per say `&str` convert it to `&'a str`, Simple as that."

I would put it at average, given the syntax is C-like, but it also has niceties like terse names for common types (i32/u32, str, u8, Vec, etc), and has type inference.  It does have stricter rules because of lifetimes and borrow checking which might make it seem wordier, and it's no lisp.\n\nIf you're referring to the prototyping usability of the language, I would put that less on the syntax and more on it being a statically typed, strict language, and lean on your point #2:\n\n> 2) Slow Compilation Time\n\nFair.  The slower compile-debug cycle and the learning curve are probably the biggest gripes against the language.  It does make up for it by catching more errors at compile time, and having great tooling and compile errors (when you're not in macro/lifetime hell).\n\n> 3) Inefficient compatibility with C. (Yes, I know ABI exists but other languages like Zig or C3 does it better)\n\nI would say this is a neutral point.  Rust has great support for cross-ABI compatibility, and because it doesn't just submit itself to being a C ABI, it gains other benefits.\n\nThere are languages that have great C ABI compatibility, but there are also languages with much worse compatibility (e.g. look at the entire Java ecosystem, or try to interact with C++ from most other languages)."

Of course, a programmer can get used to it. \n\nA \"bad\" thing is there is no good story for implementation reuse.  In OOP inheritance provides implementation reuse.  Go utilizes struct embedding to automatically delegate methods for implementation reuse.  In Rust you have generics.  But it duplicates the code during reification.

      "text": "Overall - it's a bit underdeveloped in the fine areas, both in ecosystem and in the language itself. The language and fundamental crates (game engine, GUI) are changing extremely quickly in some areas, and in some areas, not fast enough. \n\nSome of this results in libraries like embedded-hal pursuing an awkward error handling scheme *right* before they hit 1.0.0 and now it's hard to fix it without breaking all the drivers written against it.\n\nSome of this results in your ecosystem being fragmented as people quickly spin up new crates to try ideas that get abandoned a few months later. Like - with `bevy` - there's not really any good GUI option, and there's lots of random GUI framework integration crates that got quickly abandoned. Imagine starting a project with one of these - and then suddenly you're forced to maintain the entire integration layer.\n\nThe lack of a \"winning\" GUI solution is a massive painpoint in my opinion. There's also platforms like `wgpu` which are a bit immature of a project at this point - they work great on the most common platforms, but the moment you step outside to like - an embedded GPU - it falls apart.\n\nOtherwise\n\n- Writing things that can be either sync or async is difficult\n- Difficult to port between different async runtimes (embedded/desktop)\n- Partial borrowing in the borrow checker\n- The coherence constraints imposed that prevent you from implementing traits for foreign types. (this is why every single crate has a `serde` feature flag). I've run into this a surprising amount. Like - reflection in `bevy` needs you to derive something - which is really hard. And I can't really fix the error handling in embedded-hal by implementing From<weird error>\n- Lifetimes are tricky.\n- Compilation times are long.\n\n\nBut I see a ton of promising progress here. I think the only thing that isn't really fundamentally fixable is lifetimes - but that's where there's a bit of an argument to be made that if you're dealing with lifetimes a lot - your application may be better suited with a different architecture. That's part of the reason I jumped to `bevy` and ECS - it just makes dealing with a bunch of essentially globally mutable data fairly clean, painfree, and performant. There's also always the option of using a lot of Box<>/Arc<> - which is a bit verbose but ends up feeling kinda like you're just taking one step towards a language like C#/C++ with smart pointers."

Rust is an excellent first-generation product and a huge step up from C++ and the like. So I'll be keen to see the core successful parts of Rust drive further innovation with subsequent streamlined language design iterations, be it a new major version or another language entirely, such as hylo.\n\nFor the record,  my personal list would be: \n- the 'novel' module system and the compilation model. \n- async/await and coloured functions in general. Rust fell into the same trap here as C++ by prioritising 'expert opinions' and failing to adhere to the 80/20 rule. \n- ditto for macros and const functions. (The effect generics and related ideas are an incredibly idiotic path to take)\n- a lot of complexity and confusion for new users comes from areas where Rust employs non-trivial algorithms: when can you drop semicolons, which impls are in scope, coherence. I'd remove all of this in favour of explicit, obvious,  user-controlled behaviours.\n- DSTs. While theoretically they looked very nice, they added an unnecessary dimension of complexity.

First, they are unnecessarily verbose. Not only is Display a prerequisite for the Error trait, but there is no keyword to throw an error (yet). You have to `return Err(ErrorType)` instead. Errors also complicate your return types, which is arguably a good thing but still adds verbosity. Second, it’s impossible to get a stack trace from non-panic errors. I hear that people are working on this, and I KNOW how difficult it is to add this into the language as it currently stands, but this is basic functionality in every other language. From the outside, it looks like an extremely odd omission. Third, it is weirdly difficult to handle errors from multiple sources at once. Suppose you’re writing a library function with two dependencies and you need to expose errors from both dependencies to your user. To do this in Java you’d just add those error types to the “throws” keyword in the function definition. In Rust you have to create a whole new Error type (and define a corresponding Result type), and probably implement some boilerplate From traits. It’s super awkward, for both you and your users."

Not a surprise at all.\n\nI say this as someone who loves rust and has the fortune to write Rust code for a living. Once you get used to rust you do get a lot quicker in it.

Especially for a 2D game, Godot kicks ass, and I daresay its GDScript Python-like language would have been friendlier to programming newcomers than C#. And, yes, Godot also supports C#.)\n\nSpecifically I want to address the challenge of implementing high-level game logic with what the author calls a \"low-level\" language like Rust. First, I'm not sure I agree with that adjective: Rust has some very, very high-level features (I call it a dual-level language). But, sure, I agree that Rust + Bevy would be challenging to newbie programmers for various reasons.\n\nThe solution for many of us is to integrate a scripting language. There are indeed several scripting languages for Rust that are specifically made with game development in mind! I personally prefer to go with Wasm, because I also want to enable community modding via the same mechanism, but setting up Wasm is its own can of worms, as the Component Model is also a work in progress.\n\nWhatever scripting solution you choose, I would say that it's a joy to fully control its integration. I can create scripting hooks for any kind of data or system I want, exposing exactly what I want and how I want, to make sure the script author only has to provide logic. There are so many things that are specific to my game and no generic solution would be able to handle them elegantly. The result is extremely tight, readable, and maintainable game logic coding.\n\nI'm happy for the author that they managed to rewrite the whole game and stay productive, but I hope other devs in the same boat consider scripting as a way to have your cake and eat it. This is not some kind of pipe dream, it's what many of us are using successfully right now."

I'm a Java web developer currently learning Rust (via a hobby web project atm). I also wanted to eventually try my hand at a game. But I don't want to touch C# because of M$.

Rust is not even 10 years old. Adoption takes time, and C++ wasn't very popular in the beginning either.\n\nWill Rust replace languages like JavaScript, Java, C#, Go, Python etc.?

You don't hire strangers when there's only a handful of people, you hire people you _already_ trust. The jobs are advertised via personal networks.\n - Start-ups (larger): supposing they started in Rust, networking doesn't work any longer to bring in new folks. Those are the ones that will advertise.\n - Established companies: even if they adopt Rust, retraining known good employees is much cheaper, has a much more certain outcome, than hiring. Even if they _do_ hire, they're likely to chuck new hires on the _old_ projects, as there's always a trove of known good employees wishing to move to the new greenfield projects, and it's in the interest of the company to keep them happy.\n\nSo, if you're looking for jobs on job aggregators, chances are the few Rust jobs you'll find come from the larger, and still growing, start-ups. They didn't sprout up overnight -- it takes time to grow -- so they started a while ago, when Rust was even less known/less of a certain thing. This probably means technology enthusiasts, and technology enthusiasts a handful of years ago were all in on crypto-currencies... so those are the jobs that are advertised.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon, Google, & Microsoft all have a growing number of engineers they train for Rust, and are putting out project after project in the language. Embedded companies (Volvo) are similarly training their employees for Rust as they need. Et caetera. Those companies will only start recruiting for Rust when they've exhausted (or are close to exhausting) their employees, and that'll take a while.\n\nSo, you want a job in Rust?\n\nForget Linked-in, you need networking instead. You need to meet people who work in Rust:\n\n - Check out former colleagues you had a good relationship with, those are the best references.\n - Go the nearby Rust meet-ups/conferences, make a good impression -- present something! -- and let it be known you'd love to switch to working in Rust.\n - Get hired for a company which already uses Rust, even if they don't advertise it, then after proving yourself, try to see how to switch project. Do be careful to pick a company pivoting to Rust, and preferably with an already sizeable -- relatively speaking -- Rust codebase. The larger the Rust share, the easier the switch will be... and vice-versa.\n\nIf you stick to mainstream recruiting platforms, you'll get mainstream ads from large established companies. They won't be mentioning Rust, and the chances to pivot to Rust will likely be very low."

It's mostly embedded, it's mostly in fields where you need to squeeze out as much performance as possible from your chips, and it's fields where you absolutely want a *predictable* execution with as much safety built-in as is SOTA. That niche isn't web apps (Although I love using Rust for this!).\n\nAnd those are niches that are slow-moving (For good reasons) and are longing for stability. Rust is just starting to achieve that, simply by being supported over a long amount of time and by having a robust ecosystem.\n\nYou may have used Rust for years, but for these companies Rust is still really modern. It will take time for these companies to make the switch. On the other hand, we're seeing Google and Microsoft already employing thousands of Rust developers today (Who've mostly been C++ devs before).\n\nDon't forget about Rust.

I think that's because big companies will rather retrain a junior they already employ than hiring another who already knows the language, and startups need to make it to the market, so they usually cannot afford training juniors.\n\nAnd let's face it, the programming language is only one of many factors in choosing a new job.

Go is a GC language with a strong focus on concurrency and should be preferred to a non-GC language by default and by a huge margin. That we even discuss Rust vs Go is a testament to Rust's strength.\n\nAs for C and C++, I think the compliance issues around memory safety will be very real very soon, and Rust has an (almost* - see below) USP as a memory-safe language that gets by without a GC. C++ could have saved itself, but the committee seems to be rallying behind \"profiles\", which look like too little, too late at this point.\n\nSo while there are still more C++ jobs right now (disclaimer: I work one, currently), I think the writing is on the wall.\n\nRust also does have quite a bit of support from sections of Google, Microsoft, AWS and sees the occasional heavy use in other companies such as cloudflare.\n\nRust might get competition*, though. Mojo (the second noteworthy non-GC MSL) is targeting the heterogeneous computing / HPC / AI domain, where C++ is still king and Rust is not as strong as it could be. So the non-GC niche might become more splintered in the future, but contenders will probably look quite Rusty, and I strongly doubt that the future will be C++."

Of course not, the market dictated.\n\nIf people using rust think C/C++ has not been challenged before it has been. Ada is used in safety critical systems ( the euro fighter jet is 95% ada code).

      "text": "Good luck to you. I hope you keep learning about both languages and keep hanging around.\n\nMay I ask what field your new job is in? You mention common web stack apps and certain advanced data processing fields. But I don't see that as Rust's killer niche for initial adoption.\n\nRegardless of whether Rust code replaces much C++ code, the native no-GC space has more ideas and tooling work being done thanks to the Rust project. So if some safe C++ subset becomes dominant (and some people are trying to introduce that) then Rust knowledge will still be useful in that language and the Rust project will still have made a positive difference.\n\nWith that out of the way, I think most of your other arguments don't hold up, because they attempt to predict the future with false analogies.\n\nNone of your tech examples provide qualitative step change advantages for one over the other, rather they are close substitutes. VHS can do basically the same job as Betamax, from what I understand; then VHS was replaced by DVD, which had numerous qualitative advantages over VHS and therefore was worth the investment.\n\nThe safety offered by Rust today is a significant advancement in the state of the art for native code, which is why (contrary to what you wrote) all the biggest tech companies in the world are pouring resources into it, including: Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Baidu.\n\n> And the problem with Rust is that it just doesn't have critical mass\n\nCritical mass does not mean dominance. In nuclear physics, critical mass means approximately \"enough stuff for the reaction to be self-sustaining and expanding rather than fizzling out to nothing\". Which Rust is at this stage, as it is growing even despite its original sponsor Mozilla sadly dying rapidly.\n\n> and, frankly, I don't think it will ever have\n\nThis is the argument from incredulity fallacy. Just because you can't imagine it will have some quality (not critical mass, because it already has that), doesn't mean it will not have. If you want to prove your point (not that you have to, you're entitled to your opinion), you would need to provide a better argument.\n\n> Recently, Linus Torvalds complained somewhere that old C dinosaurs don't want to learn Rust.\n\nYes, and yet Rust is in the kernel mainline anyway. Rust in the Linux and Windows kernels is evidence that it offers qualitative advantages that C++ never had.\n\n> For higher level stuff (e.g.: web backends) Go offers faster iteration cycles than Rust because it has a gentler learning curve and better compile times.\n\nYour iteration cycles are only faster assuming the extra bugs that Rust catches won't significantly speed up development over Go. Depending on the app, I suspect either could win here.\n\n> Yes, Rust adoption is rising but competing technologies are also getting better (e.g.: safer C++ with better linting tools, JIT JavaScript and WASM engines getting faster) or rising faster (Go).\n\nThis seems like a version of the slippery slope fallacy. Even if C++ is getting safer incrementally (citation needed, I've seen calls to add major chunks oghe language to support Rust semantics), that doesn't mean that C++ will overtake Rust in safety; there may be a limit from its existing semantics.\n\nLikewise JavaScript engines have plateaued at several times slower in throughput than native code, because of course GC has a throughput overhead. And that's not to talk about the latency problems of GC, heroic efforts have not brought low pause time GC's into the same category as native code.\n\n> rising faster (Go).\n\nEven if Go remains more popular than Rust forever, it doesn't mean Rust hasn't succeeded or made an impact, and especially in performance and safety critical fields.\n\nFor example, in the 2010s, a lot of open source systems software was being writting in Java: Cassandra, Hadoop, Kafka. JVM constraints, especially with large heap sizes, led to all of these gaining wire-compatible C++ rewrites from companies wanting to offer more performance, e.g.: SycllaDB, Red Panda. In the 2020s, many of the new databases I see coming out are written in Rust, including internal AWS data store components for S3.\n\n> There is an huge junkyard of technologies that failed to gain broad acceptance, many of them far more revolutionary than Rust (e.g.: Lisp, Smalltalk). I don't see why those technologies' story can be avoided.\n\nWe shall see if they are avoided, but again the argument from incredulity is a fallacy. From memory, Lisp and Smalltalk were promoted on being faster to develop in that C++ or Java (and others) while being more safe than C++ and somewhat worse runtime performance than both. Rust is not offering the same value proposition. The only other languages I know of offering native level performance and memory safety are a) Rust clones and b) prototypes.\n\n> I don't see that many strong sponsors firmly behind Rust and pushing for adoption by customers.\n\nAs I stated above, many big name companies and government agencies are pushing Rust and stopping new projects in C and C++.\n\nAdoption by customers: almost all programming languages on the rise now are open-source and ecosystems are more modular than ever before. So we don't need a Sun, or an IBM, or a Microsoft, or a Google to push anything in the way they may have used to with proprietary or single company open-source technology (e.g. Golang, .NET, COBOL, Java).\n\nIf you do still want a Rust IDE, JetBrains has one, and rust-analyzer can add the features you need to many editors via LSP."

I don't feel I can predict yet how big this shift is going to be amongst our (largely C++ customers).\n\nMost of Undo's biggest fans, to date, have been C++ developers with big, legacy codebases running on commodity servers.  These companies are generally doing mission-critical stuff with their C++ and so bugs are really challenging for them.  Generally, the problems seen with their C++ code are:\n\n * Lots of hairy code - dating back a long time.\n * The original authors might not be available anymore.\n * Race conditions and memory bugs (corruptions, memory management issues, etc).\n * It's not tractable to \"just learn the code\" because of how large it is.\n * It's not tractable to \"just rewrite\" for the same reason.\n\nAs you'd expect, many of them are mentioning Rust in commercial conversations because it can help (at least partially) with these problems.  Those conversations feel quite new to me, though.  We're geeks and have been aware of Rust for the past 10+ years.  My perception is that, within the past couple of years, large C++-oriented organisations have just started to seriously think about using Rust.\n\nIf they are successful enough with this change, then they'll be building large, complex Rust codebases.  Hopefully this all means more large employers gradually posting more Rust jobs over time, especially as the original authors of the code leave and need replacing.  Whatsmore, people with C++ *and* Rust experience should be pretty useful if that transition process picks up."

People who leave Rust usually \\*don't\\* write about the issues they have, and that's a huge problem for us, because it means we mostly hear from the people who had problems that \\*weren't\\* serious enough to drive them away. \\*Thank you\\*, seriously, for caring enough to explain the issues you had in detail.\n\nI also have huge sympathies and sorrow for what sounds like \\*numerous\\* occurrences of being told that problems were your fault for not Doing Rust Right, or for being shamed for using \\`Arc\\` or similar, or any other time that you were made to feel guilty for not writing code in whatever way the complainer thought most optimal. \\*People should not do this, and I'm sad that people still do.\\*\n\n(Relatedly: could you give some idea of where you've been getting that kind of condescension? I don't see it in the Rust spaces I frequent, but it's clearly happening and I regularly see complaints about it, and I wish it didn't happen. We try, sometimes, to provide some official messaging discouraging this kind of condescension, but perhaps there's something more we can do.)\n\nI have a sticker on my laptop for \"Keep Calm and Call Clone\", and the same goes for \\`Arc\\` and similar, \\*especially\\* when you're trying to optimize for prototyping speed and iteration speed. \\*Quick hacks to get things working are fine.\\*\n\nMany of the issues you bring up here are real problems with the Rust language or with patterns commonly found in ecosystem libraries.\n\nFor instance, the orphan rule is \\*absolutely\\* a problem. It affects ecosystem scaling in multiple ways. It means that if you have a library A providing a trait and a library B providing a type, either A has to add optional support for B or B has to add optional support for A, or someone has to hack around that with a newtype wrapper. Usually, whichever library is less popular ends up adding optional support for the more popular library. This is, for instance, one reason why it's \\*really really hard\\* to write a replacement for serde: you'd have to get every crate currently providing optional serde support to provide optional support for your library as well.\n\nIn other ecosystems, you'd either add quick-and-dirty support in your application, or you'd write (and perhaps publish) an A-B crate that implements support for using A and B together. This should be possible in Rust.\n\nThere are a few potential language solutions to that. The simplest, which would likely be fairly easy and would help many applications, would be \"there can only be one implementation of a trait for a type\", giving a compiler error if there's more than one.\n\nA slightly more sophisticated rule would be \"Identical implementations are allowed and treated as a single implementation\". This would be really convenient in combination with some kind of \"standalone deriving\" mechanism, which would generate identical implementations wherever it was used.\n\nAnd hey, look, we've arrived at another of the very reasonable complaints here, namely the macro system versus having some kind of reflection. We should provide enough support to implement a standalone \\`derive Trait for Type\\` mechanism. It doesn't have to be \\*perfect\\* to be good enough for many useful purposes.\n\nSome of the other issues here might be solvable as well, and it's worth us trying to figure out what it would it take to solve them.\n\nIn any case, thank you again for writing this. I intend, with my lang hat on, to try to address some of these issues, and to encourage others to read this."

Emergent gameplay is often a good source of fun and it arises from interactions which are understandable and yet weren't explicitly coded. So you want to write behaviours which can interact, but not go through having to enumerate and implement each such interaction - it should be possible to watch somebody else play your game and be *surprised* by what happens *in the game you wrote*.\n\nI think Mario Maker shows this off really well. Nintendo's team will have hand written each of the things each part in the game can do, they should know it all, but of course the interactions between things rapidly spiral beyond what can be understood in this way, the behaviour which emerges was not specifically planned even though it's mechanical."

But it lacks flexibility, as there are no ways to work around them. \n\nThe saying about C++: \"it gives a rope and lets you hang yourself with it\" is true, and is the oposite position. You can do what ever you want with it, but it allows the developer to have a caveat and do what ever they want at some point. Accepting the risk, you have to know when you should or can bend the rules, or even how to minimize the risk. \n\nIn rust, if the rules are completely enforced by the compiler you have no way to do so. So there's been a few times in which I felt like the code correctness is placed above developer judgement, leaving you with a single option to follow. Removing any freedom of choice on what to do right or wrong, there's a single way to do stuff.\n\n  \nI come from the embedded world, and the fact that you cannot create a singleton out of a HW interface annoys me like fuck.

I'm not throwing in the towel like the author, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't keeping my eyes open for alternatives.\n\nThe root of most of the issues with the borrow checker is that there's only one first-class way to refer to a memory object in Rust: a reference with static lifetimes; every other way is a second-class citizen that requires more typing, so you're naturally guided into using them, even though game objects virtually always have dynamic lifetimes and need to refer to one another.\n\nLike the author, I found ECS to be surprisingly unfriendly to routine refactoring work.  A lot of ECS crates use `Rc<RefCell<...>>` or equivalent for component storage internally, so moving code around often leads to surprise runtime panics.  In my current game I abandoned ECS in favor of a big context struct, which seems to work okay as long as I mostly access things from the root context and minimize borrows, i.e. `ctx.foo.bar.baz = ...`.  I agree that flexibility here could be improved; I think that partial borrows of structs would be an decent ergonomic win here, for example.\n\nHere's one of my own pet peeves: Rust is strangely insistent on lifetime annotations where they could be left out.  Here's a function signature from the game I'm working on right now:\n\n    fn show_status_change(&mut self, mctx: &mut ModeContext<'_, '_>, msg: &str)\n\nThe `ModeContext` here has a couple of lifetime parameters, but the only purpose of lifetime annotations in a function signature is to relate the lifetimes of inputs to the lifetimes of outputs.  Not only are there no output lifetimes here, there isn't even an output at all, so I shouldn't have to type `<'_, '_>` at all either!  It seems small here, but I've had to type this out more than a few times over the course of development, and it adds up.\n\nUsing `Rc<RefCell<...>>` for shared mutable ownership feels clumsy with having to use `borrow` and `borrow_mut` everywhere.   If you know you only access the data within from one thread at a time and you're brave, you can use `Rc<UnsafeCell<...>>` instead and use custom `Deref` and `DerefMut` trait implementations to save on typing, plus you get to pass around proper references instead of `Ref`/`RefMut` pseudo-borrows.\n\nClosing out, I'll second the opinion that Miniquad/Macroquad and Fyrox seem useful and largely overlooked; I'm using Miniquad right now and I like its bare-bones, no-nonsense approach and minimal dependencies."

[https://jmmut.github.io/2023/03/17/Hot-reloading-Rust-and-Macroquad.html](https://jmmut.github.io/2023/03/17/Hot-reloading-Rust-and-Macroquad.html)\n\nOne of the games I'm writing has this idea implemented, and while it sometimes crashes when you change a public struct, and the code around the dylib interface could be cleaner, it is so nice to \"only\" have to wait 0.5 seconds to recompile the lib and see my changes live without restarting the game.\n\nWhile I don't fully agree with all the points in this article, I'm glad I read it, it has so many valuable insights."

Programming is a very nuanced activity, where one has to often make suboptimal choices to arrive at a result in a timely manner. The prevalence of perfectionism and obsession with \"the correct way\" in the Rust ecosystem often makes me feel that the language attracts people who are newer to programming, and are easily impressionable.\n\nHe's right. The people in this community don't know programming or Rust well. They definitely don't know other languages. It's wild how much cheerleading they do.

Yes it would be less efficient at runtime but you would be way more efficient at writing code that doesn't need to be fast.\n\nAnd because of the 80/20 rule you can write that 20% of code that has 80% of your actual performance impact with \"proper\" rust design or go unsafe when necessary.\n\nThen you would get the best of both worlds, a high level simple layer for being productive and a low level layer for hard problems, and both of these levels would be better at their jobs than C++ is at both. But people would rather switch to C# or Lua for high level code than write inefficient Rust."

      "text": "The author's perspective is on the \"short here/short now\" line. There is nothing wrong with that, it's the same perspective that many business owners have by necessity. You have bills to pay right now, you have deadlines for clients to meet right now.\n\nMy perspective as a game developer of more than 12 years is that the [\"long here/long now\"](https://notes-on-haskell.blogspot.com/2007/08/rewriting-software.html) line is more favorable. The author wants to optimize their effort in the short term, whereas I want to optimize my success in the long term. It's a sliding scale, to be sure, but the author's perspective is diametrically opposed to my own.\n\nThey want rapid iteration and \"set-it-and-forget-it\" style of coding to see if a spur of the moment idea will work, as in prototyping. I want to be assured that code I write has as few bugs as reasonably possible, including sanely handling edge cases and error conditions. In the former, a language like Lua is good enough and many gamedevs use it for this reason. In the latter, a language like Rust is good enough, and many engineers concerned with long term maintainability are attracted to it.\n\nI have written games in JavaScript, Python, and Lua, often with the same cavalier mentality, where I would just hack something together now and *maybe* revisit it later. It is quite good for getting something done for immediate gratification. But it is the bane of my existence if I'm on the hook for fixing bugs in that code later. ~~If you can make maintenance someone else's problem, it's the perfect selfish development strategy.~~ (Edit: This was unnecessary color commentary that I included about myself. It was not meant as projection or directed to anyone else.) I look back on all of the chaotic code in my old projects, and it's literally untouchable. Lua and friends do not lend themselves to fixing bugs without breaking something else.\n\nOn the other hand, I appreciate Rust for its constraints. The language makes it hard to shoot yourself in the foot. It forces you to think about mutability. Because if you don't think about it, that's a bug you just introduced. A bug that Rust would have forbidden. Rust requires you to handle the edge cases. So that your code doesn't plow ahead blindly when an error occurs, or when the wrong assumptions were made.\n\nIn direct criticism with what was written, I get a very strong sense of cognitive dissonance between the need to \"just *move on for now* and solve my problem and fix it later\" and \"fast and efficient code\". (Edit: Cognitive dissonance is normal! I'm guilty, too. I love animals but I eat meat. Some amount of cognitive dissonance is inescapable.) Using Rust because you want a game that runs fast even on moderately slow hardware but expect that \"fast code\" should be free and you can ignore details like copying or cloning vs pointers (including static, heap-allocated, and reference-counted pointer variants).\n\nThe \"better code\" and \"game faster\" continuum is something you have to navigate based on your short-term and long-term goals. Maybe Lua is the sweet spot for you? Maybe it's JVM or CLR. Maybe it's a web browser. Of all available options right now, it's Rust for me. Garbage collection is not on the table. And because I have the \"long here/long now\" mentality, I'm confident that something else in the future will be an even better fit for me than Rust is at the moment.\n\nAnother example to point out is that they specifically take note that some problems are \"self-inflicted\", and later on opine that global state makes things easier than using bevy's ECS implementation. And that might be true from some perspective, but it ignores all of the bugs that global state inevitably leads to. Usually, mutable aliasing bugs like the unsoundness mentioned in `macroquad` or the more general problem as articulated in [The Problem With Single-threaded Shared Mutability - In Pursuit of Laziness (manishearth.github.io)](https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/).\n\nBut the real problem is that drawing a line between \"global state vs ECS state\" is a completely artificial (even self-inflicted) limitation. A game can use both global state and ECS together, it isn't a matter of one or the other. That doesn't mean it will be easy. In fact, sharing mutable state is hard, regardless of whether it is local or global, and regardless of what the implementation language is.\n\nThey are absolutely right that Rust is not \"just a tool to get things done\". It's a tool to do things correctly with high performance. There are plenty of other languages to \"get things done\". They just come at the expense of correctness, performance, or both."

I believe the primary culprit here to be the fact that enum variants aren't proper types and thus not first class citizens. This could be due to Rust's legacy in OCaml where you need a type constructor for every element of every sum type. Even in everyone's most favourite hated language, Java, you could nowadays do something like:\n\n\n    sealed interface AB permits A, B {}\n    sealed interface CD permits C, D {}\n    interface ABCD extends AB, CD {}\n\n\n(Not enums though; Java enums are just collections of typed constants, more akin to Erlang atoms than Rust enums) Zig has similar functionality but relegates it to its special kind \"error\" (Zig has the kinds type and error while Rust has type and lifetime) for some unknown reason, as it is really useful outside of error handling as well. But then, this is the reason for the humongous god error enums I see in every nontrivial Rust project.\n\n\n\nI might be missing something here too, because googling the thing is really hard when what you want is en union of two enums and Rust has a language construct called union as well."

The fact that games are written in C++ today is mostly a legacy thing. C++ is (or was) the only portable language available that also compiles away all of its abstractions. It means you could write your demanding physics engine and get every ounce out of CPU as possible.\n\nToday though, all of that stuff has been written and shipped into games. So as someone or some team trying to build a new game, your budget and time are limited and every second of that needs to be on gameplay. Any time spent fussing with compiler rules or policies is time spent away from making a fun game. How would you even know the game will make the money back while you're stuck, 50% of your time, writing very low-level code.\n\nUnity is such a popular platform because its whole value proposition is that you take pre-built assets and compose them together and spend your time running your game. \n\nYou might think, what about Unreal, but there's so little C++ you NEED to write that it's basically Unity with C++ instead of C# at this point.\n\nAlso, there's nothing preventing you from using Rust for the parts of the game that need to squeeze out performance. It will happily provide all the safety you need in sections of your game that actually need that. Since, honestly, the real performance work in a game will likely be done for the GPU in shaders, something you wouldn't use Rust for anyway.\n\n  \nAnyway, thanks OP for taking the time to articulate your frustrations.

In general I think I agree with your sentiment, that Rust is primarily made by and for framework developers, rather than application devs. My hope (foolish or otherwise) is that with frameworks like Bevy, Serde, GGRS, etc., we will reach a point where the hard problems of the Rust language itself are gone. I don't say solved here because what I mean is that, for example, Bevy will become \"so good\" that the need for Arc or Refcell won't exist at the end-user site.\n\n\nMy other hope, more of a gamble really, is that Rust has a solid foundation in security, safety, and performance, at the expense of ergonomics, but the ergonomics can be patched in as the language develops. C++ is kinda in the reverse position of trying to patch in safety, and they're failing to put it bluntly. I think developer ergonomics is something more social and fashionable than fundamental (e.g., Async is a fairly new concept for languages), and Rust letting the language grammar (and more) change with any edition should help.\n\n\nAnyway, thank you for taking so much time to write out your thoughts! I really hope you and your Dev team find success in whatever technology you choose. And I hope one day Rust will improve enough for you to come back!"

      "text": "There is a religious adoration around Rust. I like Rust's original concepts, but I've been looking for some criticism of the language to get an alternative point of view before diving into it. Recently I read great post by a BITGUN developer (written in 2022), and I was wondering how his further experience with Rust turned out... And today I finally found THIS article and in the middle I realized that it is you again, the BITGUN developer. :) There seems to be little criticism of Rust and your contribution is noticeable. Thank you very much.\n\nThere are interesting arguments. The static nature of Rust can hinder rapid and agile prototyping. But maybe it is not a problem for some games? For example, point&click adventures have quite standard abstractions and mechanics, and they will only benefit from reliable code, but prototyping should take place in dynamic scenario scripts (not in Rust).\n\nRust pushes towards a certain code philosophy. My impression is that a lot of your problems with Rust are because you were struggling with it instead of accepting it. For example, you preferred global state. If developer tries to follow Rust's way, the experience can be more positive. But you tried (and you described problems with conveying context), so I understand your point here.\n\nWhat do you think about SwiftGodot? Here's a video of Miguel de Icaza (Mono developer and well-known C# promoter) criticizing C# (mostly because of garbage collector) and praising Swift:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzt36EGKEZo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzt36EGKEZo)"

But reading comments written by @kodewerx, @sephg, and others also made me realize that no language is perfect either.\n\nThat said I'll probably find other uses for Rust in the future. I'm a frontend web dev of 8 years, coming from Javascript / Typescript, and some Python, so learning things like lifetimes and more about mutability and ownership are all new to me. I've been wanting to learn a backend language for some time anyway, and I didn't like Java, and PHP / Laravel has always been a hassle.\n\nC# is my second choice, and is probably (arguably) a bit of a better choice for me. But I've enjoyed learning Rust so far. Don't know what it is, but maybe part of it is the book. I've found that I can kinda understand certain things like the lifetimes thing and ownership, simply because of how the book explains it. \n\nEh, anyways, I'm going off on a tangent here.

      "text": "I agree with many points mentioned in the article. Gamedev does have some special requirements compared to other software projects:\n\n* Games in general tend to have crazy amounts of state\n* You want to mutate that state all the time in many places\n* You want to iterate fast, prototype ideas and throw some of those away\n\n  \nI tried using very simple \"game engines\" like bindings to SDL2 or Raylib, basically just something which lets me draw stuff on the screen. That is something that works great in other languages, for example recently I tried Zig + Raylib and I was able to move fast and had great results. Doing the same thing in Rust will lead to an epic battle with the borrow checker and in my case, the borrow checker won.\n\n  \nHowever: For me bevy actually solved ALL of that. I can have as much state as I want in basically a highly efficient in-memory database. And when I write a system, I just need to specify what I need as a `Query`. This effectively means I can access anything anywhere I want while basically ignoring all the required Rust rituals when dealing with mutable state. I don't need `Arc`, `Rc`, I don't need any lifetime annotations, I don't need `clone`. I just specify what I want and the ECS gives it to me.\n\nYou are right that you still run into problems when mutating lots of different things in one system. So yes, in that case you have to refactor; something which you may not have to do in Unity or another language.\n\nBut keep in mind that bevy is still < 1.0. It is not production ready and I think UI is one of the main pain points. Every game needs at least some UI... some games require lots of UI. In any case, implementing anything remotely complex is a gigantic pain right now. Personally I am also undecided if ECS is the correct foundation for UI in general. But I have trust in the leadership of bevy coming up with a good solution."

You bump allocate memory in and unsafely use pointers to write to specific locations in memory and even the receiving end does not copy the memory, if possible. Ownership therefore might be global/shared and the way to prevent data corruption is careful pointer artihmetic (aka calculating slice position and size). The only way around this is using Atomics, but they are more expensive. Call me an idiot but I get extreme performance with this approach and with carefully taking memory alignment and memory bandwith congestion (calc the sensible defaults for L1 / L2 cache size, flatten your data, use vector intrinsics manually or unroll loops) into consideration. My code is readable still, but one has to understand how computers work at low level to get it. Anyway, the default speed for dot product with a baseline impl. of dot product on vectors with f32 and 1024 elements each is 1-2 GFLOPS and it’s single core when compiled to WebAssembly on an M3, 16 GB. I get 25 GFLOPS multicore in the browser and I‘m not even done with optimization. Would I use copy, my metrics would drop to 3 GFLOPS max. People often talk about the significance of overhead in multicore, but it‘s often multicore done wrong. If you rwlock/mutex sync with memory ownership, memory congestion is not cared for or heap copying happens with any parallelism, you certainly have a massive overhead and it bites away large parts of multicore potential. In „simple“ cases, where you do, let‘s say, some cheap glue code implementation (copying and transforming small objects of data, calling a few APIs and calling it a day), everything I wrote is unimportant. And to be honest, this is the case for the majority of projects. However, if you‘re working on algorithms that need to be fast to be useful, then everything you do should be aligned with the majority of target hardware. Copy and even intermitted/frequent malloc is the devil in those cases. So yes, use copy() as you like, but you will run into wall at high speed the moment you‘re trying to achieve peak performance (say you‘re building a VM, or audio or video DSP) - in those cases you‘d suddenly have to rewrite your whole codebase if it is not architected for performance from the very beginning.

All of your usize variables just doubled their memory consumption since it was not defined with a confined scope. \n\nAnd even rust wastes space by allocating a full byte, u8 I think, for each Boolean. \n\nSo if you allocate a usize for an index counter ( I know I would use an iterator too ) that only counted to 10 in a loop. You would waste 56bits on the stack.  \n\nTo young developers, they say so what. When you multiply that space by millions when you take an app from lab to scale.

Not a big deal really \n\nAnd honestly, it's really hard to justify writing anything in C over Rust \n\nBasically I feel like you need to explain why you aren't writing in Rust"

Slower rust code also seems to have more low-hanging-fruit potential for easy speedups; there are countless stories of a 2x speed improvement because of an easy removal of allocations in a hot loop.\n- Because of Rust's nature as a language, it tends to attact developers who are much more obsessed with robust and correct code, relative to what we might call the median. Often this obsession comes at the cost of perfectionism or \"unreasonable time-to-ship\", but when combined with Rust's policy of \"ship a whole static binary that only dynamically links to libc\", it means that ON AVERAGE you tend to find that a particular random rust project is more likely to have fewer bugs and continue working correctly with minimal maintenence than an equivelent in a random other language (no fighting with virtual environments 2 years later, for example).\n\nIt's worth noting that both of these impressions are entirely anecdotal, and I have no data to backup my impressions of either rust software or rust developers. But since your question was about Rust's  reputation, these are my impressions of why the reputation arises."

Since Rust is relatively new language, applications written in Rust tend to be more modern: the authors have decades of experience to draw upon (see [zellij](https://zellij.dev/tutorials/basic-functionality/) for example; the closest alternative in C/C++ land is tmux). \n\n* Furthermore, because adding new crates to projects is so easy, you can relatively easily add new functionality to your projects. As a result, applications written in Rust might be more featureful.\n\n* Rust TUI applications tend to look plain better compared to alternatives, most likely thanks to availability of high quality TUI crates (see [dua](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli) or [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi)).\n\n* Rust applications are easier to install. `cargo install` is typically all you need. Most of the time you don't need to play with `apt install` to find the right dependencies for project to compile. Once installed, the application is most likely a single binary that lives in `~/.cargo/bin` that has no external dependencies. Thus if you upgrade your OS you don't have to worry about dependencies getting broken as everything in Rust is mostly statically linked.\n\n* Great performance."

It was supposed to be a small program with a specific use case, but over the past two years, it has worked so well, the program has ended up being the foundation for most of the products we make. We've stopped C++ development and are just transitioning features to the rust program.\n\nI was skeptic at first, and I certainly voiced some frustrated complaints on Reddit and other forums. I am firmly against the constant creation of new language just because some programmer got frustrated with an esoteric feature of a mature language or because some vendor (Microsoft or Apple) wants to lock in developers. I think your post is asking the right questions.\n\nThinking only from the perspective of the end-user, what I've learned from five years doing Rust development is:\n1. Rust actually solves problems that few other languages are solving. Most of our programs are asynchronous or multi-threaded, and Rust has eliminated most of the bugs we see in the field. Better stability, less RAM use, safer code; we see all this.\n2. We roll out more features into a program at a better pace because we're not burning half of our time chasing support issues.\n3. While it's possible that someday C or C++ could start integrating the \"safety\" features of Rust... they won't. They just won't. And while I'm generally opposed to junking existing codebases, I don't think anyone should be deluding themselves that C/C++ will ever improve the language to the safety level of Rust.\n4. We see far better performance with Rust than with C# (which I kicked out of the building a few years ago), and -- speaking only anecdotally -- I believe the Rust versions of our software are out-performing the C++ versions. \n5. OPINION ALERT: I think the way that Rust is governed and freely available is a benefit not just to programmers but also to users because the language is going to be focused on features and stability, not business decisions. \n\nI have a lot of reasons that developers should start transitioning to Rust, and I highly recommend companies hiring young, inexperienced talent just out of college to strongly consider migrating to Rust. We did a trial run of this over the summer. Having to train a new hire on CMake, cross-platform, cross-compilation issues (things they don't teach in college)... the training time is impractical. With Rust and Cargo, a project went scratch to published in three weeks. It was a small utility program, but the programmer had never used Rust before and getting him up and running was a fast and smooth experience."

The first is that a lot of tools are written with slower languages like Python and TypeScript, which makes for a bit of lag when starting up the tool, or longer overall runtime if it's computationally heavy (like type checkers, linters, etc), but I can reasonably expect this tool to be fast since it's a compiled tool. You can still make it slow, but it's less likely. My rust-written tools usually feel 'instant' in a way that my interpreted language tools don't.\n\nThe second thing is that I can expect a large portion (up to all of it) to be verified correct in a way that's not likely to result in a memory corruption bug, which are some of the biggest security issues. There's limits to this, such as any unsafe code/calls to C libs that may have issues, but I'd expect that to be quite the minority case.\n\nThe third is that I'm more likely to be able to contribute to it since Rust is something I know, and even if I didn't, it's easier to use than something like C, which is simple in spec but requires a great deal of savvy to avoid its pitfalls."

But if I have absolutely nothing to go on, it would put my money on the rust code being of higher quality.\n\nI'm sure you've heard it already. Rust compiler is extremely nitpicky relative to other languages, there are rules it applies to your code by default. Sidestepping these rules require explicit declaration, it can easily be detected. It doesn't make rust code better than a comparatively competently developed project in another language, but there is a minimum standard that is hard to go under.\n\nRust code is less likely to have memory safety issues, but otherwise it can have bugs just like any other language. The \"minimum standard\" I mentioned is general across the board, you can't point to a single aspect of rust to be better, or even to any single rust project. It's just generally better.\n\nI personally don't think there's much to brag about though. I still think C devs who manage to work with C in a safe and controlled manner are absolutely incredible. Rust has a steeper learning curve, but it tapers off and becomes gentler while C becomes increasingly arcane.\n\nI'm personally a \"GPLv3 in my free time\" programmer so I'm not too sure.

      "text": "Directly? No, being written in Rust is _not_ a feature. Oftentimes, people add that to their readme page because they're passionate about Rust, or they're learning it right now, or they _do_ think it is a feature somehow, which is incorrect.\n\nAs an end-user of an application, I don't give a damn what language it is written in, _if_ the application is stable, reliable, functional, has good performance and efficiency, and has the features I want.\n\nHowever, that's not the end of the story, because there _is_ a kernel of truth to this idea -- the language you use to write a program _does_ often have some effects on the program itself and the user experience. Not always, but sometimes.\n\nFor example, if a command-line tool is written in Go, I can expect that tool to be available as a precompiled standalone binary. Which _is_ a nice feature. The reason why I expect that is because its so easy to do that with Go. It is **not** easy to do that if your application is written in, say, JavaScript. Rust also has a similar role in this same feature; while not as easy as Go, its still pretty easy to compile most programs to a standalone binary if its written in pure Rust. So if \"comes as a standalone binary\" is a feature I desire, then the odds of that feature being offered, even if not mentioned, goes up considerably if it is written in Go or Rust.\n\nAnother feature is performance and efficiency. If I am looking for a program and I'd rather it didn't use a ton of memory, then the odds of that go down considerably if I see your application is written in Java. Not because Java _inherently_ requires a lot of memory, but because the way the standard library is designed and most popular Java libraries are implemented, it basically _encourages_ applications to be memory-hungry.\n\nAnother example is applications using the Electron framework, which is somewhat notorious for being memory hungry. _Can_ you write a relatively memory-efficient Electron app? Yes! But it is pretty hard to do, and if you just write the UI like any ordinary heavy modern frontend JavaScript app (like most people) then no, it will be memory hungry. So if I see an app written using Electron, I might avoid it even if \"uses a lot of memory\" isn't written on the readme.\n\nBut if your application is written in Rust, it is probably very low on memory usage. Not guaranteed to be so, but the odds are significantly greater. Once again, \"low memory usage\" may not be written on the readme, but if it is written in Rust, it is likely that this is true."

A lot of tools I've used that are written in rust have amazing DX, and I think it's because they have great packages (or crates I guess it's called) for creating CLIs. Rust also pushes good standards imo, and a way of thinking that forces you to program in a more consistent and structured way. That reflects through the interfaces to tools written in Rust.\n\nPerformance is also often shockingly fast after rewrites, or compared to alternatives in other languages."

Even a Python application can be great. I'm thinking of the Kitty terminal emulator, written in Python, which indeed has a deserved reputation for being fast and stable.\n\nMy conclusion is that it's not a good idea to put \"written in Rust\" front and center.

The other is that, when you see a rust script, you most likely weed out the script kitties (nothing against em, but they don't always have the fundamentals down perfectly) and the \"near native\" babies won't shoot themselves in the foot with pointers, cause they can't.\n\nImo, the biggest advantage of rudt over day, python or java, is that it attracts decent programmers.

It forces you to structure your app in a sane way, because you have to think about what owns memory, how is it gonna be accessed, and the type system lets you express constraints much better than the typical languages. You can't forget to catch an exception in Rust, you can't forget to check an error, there's just a lot of bad patterns Rust simply won't let you get away with: it forces you to handle or propagate errors properly, and that just eliminates entire classes of problems such as the program failing to load something and keep going in an undefined state.\n\nThat translates into more reliable software for end users. Not that you can't do the same in Python or even JavaScript, there's some solid apps in those languages out there. But Rust puts an inherent lower bound on how bad it can be. And also generally, people that use Rust are better developers because the bad ones are just out there constantly whining about how much the borrow checker gets in your way and how \"hard\" Rust is to develop into."

For various reasons it's almost unheard of for a library written in say Java or Go, to be called from a program written in say Python or JS. But it's common for C and C++ libraries to be used that way, and Rust is a new contender here.

He makes the claim that developers who learn Python do it because they see the merits of the language, and are passionate about programming, meanwhile oftentimes Java programmers learn the language solely to land a job. \n\nHe puts it pretty well: “if a company chooses to write its software in a comparatively esoteric language, they'll be able to hire better programmers, because they'll attract only those who cared enough to learn it”. \n\nI think Rust and other “hippie” languages fit into that same niche of Python from 2004; a language that doesn’t (yet) have a lot of job prospects, but attracts a very passionate crowd, and that passionate crowd tend to care a lot about programming, and ergo make better programmers. \n\n[Here’s the link to the article](https://paulgraham.com/pypar.html)"

      "text": "Hey fellow Rustaceans! 🦀\n\nI’m excited to announce the release of **[`eval-macro`](https://crates.io/crates/eval-macro)**, a new crate that brings a fresh approach to writing Rust macros.\n\n---\n\n### 📚 IMPORTANT: Documentation Notice\n\n🚨🚨🚨 **Docs.rs is currently not working for this crate (should be back in 1-2 days). In the meantime, you can read the full documentation and examples here:**  \n👉👉👉 **[https://github.com/wdanilo/eval-macro/blob/main/lib/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/wdanilo/eval-macro/blob/main/lib/src/lib.rs)** 👈👈👈\n\n---\n\n### 🔥 What is `eval-macro`?\n\n`eval-macro` lets you write **inline Rust code** that gets evaluated **at compile time** to generate Rust code. It combines the **power of procedural macros** with the **ease of `macro_rules!`**, giving you a much more flexible and intuitive way to write code-generating macros.\n\n---\n\n### 🛠️ Key Features\n\n- ✅ **As easy to use as `macro_rules!`** — you define `eval!` blocks directly in your files, with no need for separate macro crates.\n- ✅ **More powerful than procedural macros** — `eval-macro` can work with **both regular Rust source code and token streams**.\n- ✅ **Write normal Rust code to generate new code** — use loops, conditionals, and any Rust logic directly in the macro body.\n- ✅ **Inline code generation with `output!`**, supporting variable interpolation for flexible templating.\n- ✅ **Per-macro dependencies and Cargo attributes**, so each `eval!` block can have its own environment.\n- ✅ Designed for in-crate code generation — no need to export or register the macro in `Cargo.toml`.\n\n**In short: `eval-macro` gives you the simplicity of `macro_rules!`, combined with the raw power of procedural macros — and even more flexibility!** However, it is not reusable across modules, making it ideal for in-module (one-shot) code generation.\n\n---\n\n### 📖 Example\n\n```rust\nuse eval_macro::eval;\n\nstruct Position {\n    x: f32,\n    y: f32,\n    z: f32,\n}\n\neval! {\n    let fields = [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"];\n    for field in &fields {\n        output! {\n            impl Position {\n                pub fn get_{{field}}(&self) -> f32 {\n                    self.{{field}}\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Use eval! to compute a constant at compile time\nconst MY_NUM: usize = eval! { \n    (std::f32::consts::PI.sqrt() * 10.0).round() as usize \n};\n```\n\n---\n\n### 🪲 Debugging and Diagnostics\n\n`eval-macro` supports **logging, warnings, and errors directly from your macro** during compilation, making debugging generated code much easier than with procedural macros.\n\n---\n\n### 📦 Get Started!\n\n📚 **Crates.io**: [https://crates.io/crates/eval-macro](https://crates.io/crates/eval-macro)  \n📖 **Temporary Docs**: 👉 [https://github.com/wdanilo/eval-macro/blob/main/lib/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/wdanilo/eval-macro/blob/main/lib/src/lib.rs) 👈  \n💻 **GitHub**: [https://github.com/wdanilo/eval-macro](https://github.com/wdanilo/eval-macro)\n\n---\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and ideas for future improvements! 🎉\n\n---\n\n**❤️❤️❤️ EDIT ❤️❤️❤️** \n\nAfter reading some of the comments, I realized that this macro can be more powerful than I thought. Initially, I thought we can't export it, the same way as we are able to export `macro_rules!`, but we can. Consider this example:\n\n```rust\n#[macro_export]\nmacro_rules gen_fields! {\n    ($struct_name:ident) => {\n        eval_macro::eval! {\n            let fields = [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"];\n            for field in &fields {\n                output! {\n                    impl $struct_name {\n                        pub fn get_{{field}}(&self) -> f32 {\n                            self.{{field}}\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    };\n}\n```\n\nThis way we can export the macro to be re-used between crates and modules. I know it's not pretty. I will think for future releases if we can make it easier."

To make sense of things, I decided to study V8 a bit.\nSince I was also learning Rust (because why not make life more interesting?), I thought: “What if I try porting this idea to Rust?” And that’s how I started the journey of writing this engine in Rust.\nBelow is the repository and the progress I’ve made so far:\n[ https://github.com/wendelmax/v8-rust ](https://github.com/wendelmax/v8-rust)\n\nNote:\nThis isn’t a rewrite or port of V8 itself. It’s a brand new JavaScript engine, built from scratch in Rust, but inspired by V8’s architecture and ideas. All the code is original, so if you spot any bugs, you know exactly who to blame!\n\nLast update:\n"

      "text": "I know this might get a little shit, but I’m all for it. I have some suggestions, or tips rather, if I may?\n\nI, too, have been working on rebuilding a major, used everyday system in Rust. I’ve been working on it for nearly 18 months and am very close to being able to ship a relatively polished v1. Here’s what I learned along the way:\n\nA) It’s okay to break legacy convention. In fact, I almost suggest you try to as often as possible. This just means be original in your implementation. Rust allows us to write code that wasn’t possible at the time these legacy systems were engineered - ignoring that in shortsightedness or some purist ideal is silly. \n\nB) Migration for something like this is almost absolute. If it’s not a clear migration path, it’s going to struggle regardless of its strengths in most cases. In my own situation, there are enough low level differences that I was forced to build an entire migration engine and have been testing it on 150k fixtures via AWS instances to get it right.\n\nC) A lot of the tools we use today were built by cracked engineers at a different point in time. They built for the hardware that was around; they built for the wire protocols that were around; they cared about storage engine page sizes and how operating systems behaved at that point in time. You have twice the work; first you need to do the exact same today, AND think about their work and how it translates. In my situation, I gained a LOT rethinking a storage engine from scratch. It took me MONTHs of bullshit yak shaving, but it changed the entire dynamic. Look at the systems they targeted and understand why.\n\nD) Build in trait abstractions and extensibility from day one as often as possible. In fact, think of your codebase like a trunk with swappable pieces. Huge systems like browser engines, operating systems, databases, version control systems, etc. are almost always going to change regularly. Make it easy on yourself and think through your design patterns.\n\nE) You absolutely need to work through each individual piece now, and have a solid understanding of what that looks like. This took me months. I assumed I had something figured out and realized I actually didn’t know shit. Be aware of how huge the task is, and be aware that you’re going to be caught off guard a lot.\n\nFinally, I would just say use the full power of Rust. Lock down unsafe code in islands behind features. Get creative with your tests. Benchmark aggressively and build all of this into your CI. It will keep you sane. As with everything real, build observability into the system from day one. \n\nKeep us posted! I’m watching!"

Its unique ownership system enforces strict rules at compile time, preventing data races, dangling pointers, and buffer overflows before the code even runs. This makes Rust especially valuable for building secure systems, from operating systems to web servers, where reliability and stability are critical. By fostering both safety and performance, Rust enables developers to write code that’s not only blazingly fast but also robust and maintainable—without sacrificing expressiveness or flexibility.\n\n$40 plz."

Immutable lists are lists too and nothing prevents you from calling add method on an immutable list. Only you get a surprise exception at run time. \nIf you take Python, the zen contradicts the language in many ways.\nIn Fsharp you can write functional code that looks clean, but because of the unpredictable ways in which the language boxes and unboxes stuff, you often get slow code. Also some decisions taken at the beginning make it so that you end up with unfixable problems as the language evolves.\nCompared to all these Rust seems predictable and although the language has a lot of features, they are all coherently developed and do not contradict one another.\nIs it because of the creator of the language doing a good job or the committee behind the language features has a good process?"

Your particular examples are interesting though.\n\nJava was well, almost beautifully, organized back in the day.  But 25 years of language additions, with a commit to not break any old code if at all possible, has made it a horrible mess. C#, which is pretty much Java,  doesn't care about breaking old code  (they just version the C# runtimes). So they have been able to add/remove/correct things with concern about breaking older code.\n\nHowever, a big influence on C# that has lead to ugliness (in places) is that it needs to maintain compatibility and interoperability with all the other .NET family of languages, C#, F#, Visual Basic .NET. And it needs to be keep in sync with  how the APIs of  Microsoft's C++ , Powershell ,Microsoft Products, Office MS SQL, Windows,Windows Server. \n\nWhether, when, and how to do Box/Unboxing has to interoperate throughout all that mess. Keeping mind that in general boxing is messy problem to solve. You can handle it a very easy and consistent manner (always keep all primitives boxed) but at a huge performance penalty. Optimum performance can only really come from having the programmer manually handle all boxing operations.   Programmers don't want to do that, and you need programmers to really understand all the performance issues to even do it well. So most languages pick some middle ground between the two. When you add in the complexity of smoothly working with all of Microsoft's things, it can get ugly, which is why F#'s boxing is what it is."

      "text": "I think it has less to do with modernity; it's more about expertise and domain knowledge. **Rust was actually designed by experts in PL.**\n\nLet's just look at the core features of Rust: algebraic data types were invented in the 1970s by Robin Milner et al., and well-known by the 90s. Traits were first implemented in Haskell (as \"type classes\") by Phillip Wadler and Stephen Blott, in the late 80s. Region-based memory management, a precursor to Rust's lifetime model, was pioneered in the 90s by Mads Tofte and Jean-Pierre Talpin et al., particularly in the MLKit implementation of Standard ML. Substructural type systems, which form the core of Rust move semantics, were known in the 1980s and Phillip Wadler was famously a proponent as early as the early 90s. In the early 2000s, Hongwei Xi famously created ATS, a very expressive programming language that very much presaged Rust in terms of memory management, but it never caught on due to complexity and poor documentation.\n\nSo none of these ideas are new; some are, in fact, as old as C! So why didn't anyone create Rust earlier? The answer, IMO, is that most programmers don't know much about programming languages (and how a good PL can completely change the dev experience), **and most popular languages are actually designed by people who know very little about programming languages**.\n\nPython's inventor famously didn't know much about PL design, and is often outright wrong on many things. Java was actually designed by computer scientists with PhDs specializing in programming languages (James Gosling and Guy Steele Jr.), but (1) corporate demands limited their design space, and (2) in the 90s, some strange cargo-cult worship of object-oriented programming was going on. Proponents advocated programming in accordance to strict design patterns, and to prioritize extensibility over everything else, leading to severe over-design. Java was guilty of pushing this OO excess even further, but by the time people thought it was too much, it was already too big to fail and impossible to change things."

      "text": "It's not perfect! There's many rough edges, especially the syntax. This is partly because it was designed by a bunch of C++ programmers that were very used to repeating themselves. (In C/C++ you typically write every definition twice, once in a .h file and once in a .c(pp) file.)\n\nAs an example, take any simple struct type that implements some traits. You'll have to repeat the name of the struct at least a dozen times, often with variations like \"Self\", but it's not even consistent!\n\nJava and C# nest methods inside their type definition so that you don't have to repeatedly type the enclosing type name over and over. Similarly, the usage of \"this\" is much more consistent than self is in Rust.\n\nThe other fun landmine is shadowing of variables, which is an insane feature that *will* be used by a nation state to hack someone. This \"but it's so convenient!\" feature allows a variable 'x' to be shadowed three pages of code later by another variable 'x' with a different type *in the same scope*.\n\nIt's insane to me that in a strongly typed language this compiles and works: https://godbolt.org/z/1naxYnYoK\n\nThis is a hacker's wet dream. Like the 'xz tools' attack, someone could sneak in code into open source repositories that at first glance and *even careful reading* would look innocent, because humans are physically unable to track hundreds of identifiers and their changes in their brain across a huge block of code. Compilers can, sure, but *humans can't*. That's why most languages don't allow this, it's a trap for squish meat brains.\n\nI confused *myself* several times with this issue in just *one* page of code, each time losing about a day to trying to figure out why I was getting unexpected behavior from code that superficially looked okay. If someone *malicious* does this in a multi-page function, there's no chance it'll be caught by even a careful PR review process."

It's insane.\n\nTo clarify, I'm not just talking about the number of dependencies, but about the fact that each of them are a crate, in wide majority with a much wider goal than your project has, making it contain additional abstractions that pertain to cases you don't care about much more often than ones where you do.\n\nWith that level of granularity, the amount of code you end up compiling is insanely higher than it should've been. For example, if you run `cargo vendor` on winit and run `tokei vendor` to check how many lines of Rust code there are in there, it's gonna come to **4,273,179** LOC (**3,424,174** without counting blanks). Now to be fair, most of these lines actually come from bindgen crates:\n\n    13467    vendor/objc2-0.5.2\n    13738    vendor/objc2-metal\n    16615    vendor/objc2-core-graphics\n    16818    vendor/objc2\n    24717    vendor/x11rb\n    30978    vendor/objc2-core-foundation\n    44599    vendor/rustix-0.38.44\n    46643    vendor/objc2-foundation-0.2.2\n    48089    vendor/rustix\n    53485    vendor/objc2-foundation\n    79996    vendor/objc2-app-kit\n    81105    vendor/objc2-ui-kit\n    104443    vendor/ndk-sys\n    110098    vendor/libc\n    130057    vendor/x11rb-protocol\n    176630    vendor/winapi\n    195823    vendor/web-sys\n    286899    vendor/windows-sys\n    329641    vendor/linux-raw-sys-0.4.15\n    366473    vendor/linux-raw-sys\n    487675    vendor/windows-sys-0.45.0\n\nAll of these sum up to 2,657,989 LOC, which is, funnily enough, only **62%** of the vendors. Which means that winit is still compiling **1,615,190** lines of code outside of bindgen crates. No, it should really not be that high even for winit. (Also note that some of these are duplicated to hell.)\n\nThe one example I always give for a big project that doesn't have this problem is [raddebugger](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/raddebugger), made from scratch, including windowing and graphics, and now compiles on Linux too (though nothing works in the debugger, only the interface works). Last time I checked the project was about 100k lines of C, which is a 16th of the non-bindgen code that winit depends on, and it's _an entire debugger_. And the whole project compiles in under 5 seconds on my machine with a single translation unit.\n\nSeriously, I think we can do better than this. Dependencies should have a much bigger granularity so that these problems don't get this bad."

(where this cancer explicitly is a cross-language codebase and not rust itself, just to escape the flameware brigade).\n\nCan someone please point out where this person openly admits to attempting sabotage? This just seems like a simple case of, \"it's too difficult to try to work across language barriers\". Like isn't that a genuine concern? Does it not genuinely create an artificial boundary?\n\nHector is misrepresenting this person IMO. It feels wrong to put them on blast for this. Just because we don't share the same concerns as them doesn't make theirs less valid.\n\nedit: Formatting"

This pattern is **very** common in the Rust ecosystem\n\nI personally think this is an anti-pattern and unfortunate that is has become the standard.\n\nWhat about if each function had a separate error enum. Functions calling other, lower-level functions could compose those smaller error enums with `#[error(transparent)]` into larger enums.

I usually either want the one big set of enum variants you describe or literally one error as in the above link.\n\nAs a concrete example: the AWS SDK doesn't even get super specific, but each service (s3, ec2, ecs, etc.) gets its own error enum, basically. I usually write a lot of functions that just use `?` to return the error I encounter. That's easy if there's just one error type. But if my function happens to call across multiple services in the AWS SDK, this suddenly becomes a bigger hassle. Then what do I do? Again, my goal is just to bubble the error up to the caller, not create my own error, not to deal with it myself. Should I create an enum for every combination of service errors in every function? I can do that, but it's annoying for me and I think annoying for the user, especially if those combinations change over time, meaning my crate will have more breaking changes over error handling and that sucks.\n\nI don't think the AWS SDK necessarily should have done anything differently, but it's just an example of how multiple error types can get in the way of ergonomics."

In my opinion, that approach is *far* more problematic than \"big enum used widely where most users won't actually ever return most error types\", not to say the latter also isn't far from ideal. But at least it scales beyond tiny code bases, the \"risk level\" remaining more or less constant, whereas \"boilerplate explosion\" is only really at all viable for very small projects, IMO.\n\nMany ideas are being floated, but from my POV, the solution ultimately has to boil down to declaring each canonical error type *once*, somewhere, devoid of any context or groupings, then your error sets (ideally declared fully inline at function declarations, unless they will be used in multiple places) just list which canonical error types may occur in this specific context. Plus an easy way to indicate \"also include all errors from this other set\" that treats the added errors as first-class citizens no different from all the ones you explicitly listed out, rather than one inscrutable black box that requires special treatment."

And in that scenario, you will ALWAYS know which errors to match for, because you know which errors are recoverable (or need to be handled differently in any other way). You will always have two groups of errors - ones that you want to handle explicitly, and \"the rest\". In a match statement, \"the rest\" will look like the wildcard match \\`\\_ => {}\\`. So what do you care that there are some errors that might not be returned from that function? They don't affect your code at all.\n\nThe only downside to the big error enums is that you might not know which errors a function might return, but that is better solved using documentation"

Are you passing an immutable reference? If so, you know the referent can't be mutated. Etc.\n\nIMO, being clear about what errors can be returned is crucial in order to enable local reasoning. Rust feels much more like LEGO that way.

As such, return a string of it. It is the flexible way to explain to a human what happened.\n\nRelatedly, exception handling is best done close to the outermost loop of a program. For example, if an HTTP server generates an exception internally, it is best to propagate it out and return a 500 from the handler. Java tried checked exceptions, and it went badly, among other reasons because there is usually nothing to do except rethrow the exception, so catching it is juat a chance to do someyhing wrong, with no upside of possibly doing anything useful.\n\nThere are exceptions and nuances, for sure, but my go to approach in Rust is a String."

      "text": "Context-Generic Programming (CGP) offers a different approach for error handling in Rust, which is described here: https://patterns.contextgeneric.dev/error-handling.html.\n\nIn short, instead of hard-coding your code to return a concrete error type, you instead write code that is generic over a context that provides an *abstract* error type, and use *dependency injection* to require the context to handle a specific error for you.\n\nAs a demonstration, the simplest way you can write such generic code as follows:\n\n```rust\n#[blanket_trait]\npub trait DoFoo: CanRaiseError<std::io::Error> {\n    fn do_foo(&self) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {\n        let foo = std::fs::read(\"foo.txt\").map_err(Self::raise_error)?;\n\n        // do something\n\n        Ok(())\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, instead of writing a bare `do_foo()` function, we write a `DoFoo` trait that is automatically implemented through the `#[blanket_trait]` macro. We also require the context, i.e. `Self`, to implement `CanRaiseError` for the error that may happen in our function, i.e. `std::io::Error`. The method `do_foo` returns an abstract `Self::Error`, of which the concrete error type will be decided by the context. With that, we can now call functions like `std::fs::read` inside our method, and use `.map_err(Self::raise_error)` to handle the error for us.\n\nBy decoupling the implementation from the context and the error, we can now use our `do_foo` method with any context of choice. For example, we can define an `App` context that uses `anyhow::Error` as the error type as follows:\n\n```rust\n#[cgp_context]\npub struct App;\n\ndelegate_components! {\n    AppComponents {\n        ErrorTypeProviderComponent:\n            UseAnyhowError,\n        ErrorRaiserComponent:\n            RaiseAnyhowError,\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWe just use `#[cgp_context]` to turn `App` into a CGP context, and wire it with `UseAnyhowError` and `RaiseAnyhowError` to handle the error using `anyhow::Error`. With that, we can instantiate `App` and call `do_foo` inside a function like main:\n\n```rust\nfn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {\n    let app = App;\n\n    app.do_foo()?;\n    // do other things\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nThe main strength of CGP's error handling approach is that you can change the error handling strategy to anything that the application needs. For example, we can later change `App` to use a custom `AppError` type with `thiserror` as follows:\n\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Error)]\npub enum AppError {\n    #[error(\"I/O error\")]\n    Io(#[from] std::io::Error),\n}\n\ndelegate_components! {\n    AppComponents {\n        ErrorTypeProviderComponent:\n            UseType<AppError>,\n        ErrorRaiserComponent:\n            RaiseFrom,\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd now we have a new application that returns the custom `AppError`:\n\n```rust\nfn main() -> Result<(), AppError> {\n    let app = App;\n\n    app.do_foo()?;\n    // do other things\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nThe two versions of `App` can even co-exist in separate crates. This means that our example function `do_foo` can now be used in any application, without being coupled with a specific error type.\n\nCGP also allows us to provide additional dependencies via the context, such as configuration, database connection, or even raising multiple errors. So you could also write the example `do_foo` function with many more dependencies, such as follows:\n\n```rust\n#[blanket_trait]\npub trait DoFoo: \n    HasConfig \n    + HasDatabase \n    + CanRaiseError<std::io::Error> \n    + CanRaiseError<serde_json::Error>\n{\n    fn do_foo(&self) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI hope you find this interesting, and do visit the [project website](https://contextgeneric.dev/) to learn more."

It's ***trivial*** to pull out the error conditions you do actually care about and know how to handle in a `match` and throw up if you don't. Sure, it would be slightly better to create a new error type for each function, but IME it's really *not* worth the effort. I personally *like* the status quo quite a bit because *if* you follow it, you define your error transformations in one place and can use `?` pretty much everywhere, picking out locally recoverable conditions with your favorite pattern matching operation.\n\nI also really don't want to go digging around in docs or submodules so I can import the correct error type returned by a function. One import for one library is quite nice.\n\nOne thing I do to make this easier in many cases is implement `From<&str> for Error` / `From<String> for Erorr` and have an `Unknown(String)` (or `Internal(&'static str)`) error variants to make defining `grep`-able errors without tons of boilerplate when all that happens is the message gets propagated to the user or logged."

If the same error type is returned by every single function in the crate, that enum will quickly balloon into like an unmanageable number of variants. There should be different error types, divided by the contexts in which they occur. You might have a few major modules in your code, and each one of them would have their own error types. The public error type will then have appropriate From or Source impls for them. This is the pattern that's promoted by the Snafu crate (https://docs.rs/snafu/latest/snafu/)"

As a library, usually, nothing returns the top-level enumeration—it serves as a catch-all for the convenience of the user of my library.\n\nTwo challenges with the top-level roll-up `Error` type:\n\ni) Consider marking it `#[non_exhaustive]` to avoid breaking your ysers as you add new sub-`Error`s.\n\nii) Each fallible function returns the lowest level error possible to maximize granularity.  Usually I only need two levels of hierarchy, but when there are more, the art of making multiple hops from a low-level `Error` to the top level is ugly/boilerplatey.\n\nBut usually, With `thiserror`, there’s a little boilerplate (like `pub type Result<T, E = Error> = core::result::Result<T, E>;`) but there’s not much—maybe 3 lines outside of the `Error` type itself.\n\nAs you suggest, this does neatly avoid having to deal with an `Error` type which only uses 1 out of 40 variants.\n\nThe sub-`Error` types can start out as 1 per function, but where there is commonality (e.g. `input_validation::Error`) I prefer to DRY my impl and define that `Error` type only once.\n\nOne can define the `Error` hierarchy under a crate-wide module or in a distributed, define-where-used strategy.  And depending on your use case, you may be able to elide defining the top-level wrapping `Error` type if `dyn Error` is feasible in your domain).\n\nSo short answer, yes, I agree that more granular `Error` types are good.

It sucks? yes. But that's how it is. Rust is GUI already because with stuff like Tauri, Electron, ... you can just a few bits of native code alongside web technologies and that covers the 99% of their needs.

I am no visionary but if Linux doesn't internalize this, I'm afraid some other kernel will do to it what it did to Unix.\n\nI don't like the thought of Linux falling victim to \"Adapt or die.\" But at the same time, if Linux doesn't *try* to adapt, it *will* die.\n\nEven if it turns out that Rust doesn't belong in the kernel, I still want to see Linux try it.

      "text": "# Intro\n\nI've used Rust for somewhere around ~10 years at this point, since shortly before Rust 1.0 was released in May 2015. I've worked on a bunch of different projects in Rust including desktop GUI apps, server backends, CLI programs, sandboxed scripting interfaces via WASM, and multiple game-related projects. Most recently, I've done a ton of work contributing to the Bevy game engine. \n\nI also have a good amount of experience with several other languages: Java, Python, Typescript, Elixir, C, and several more niche ones with correspondingly less experience. Not enough to say that I'm an expert in them, but enough that I'm familiar with and have experienced the major tradeoffs between them. I'll mainly be comparing Rust to Java, as that's what I've been using a lot lately outside of Rust.\n\nOut of all of these, Rust is by far my favorite language, and I'm not planning on going anywhere! I use it daily, and it's been a joy to work with 90% of the time. \n\nOf course like any language that gets actually _used_, it has it's problems. Moments where you go \"what the heck? Why? Oh, hrmm, ok maybe this? Not quite, this is frustrating\". _I'm not here to talk about those cases_.\n\nWhat I'm here to talk about are the _major_ pain points I've experienced. The problems that have come up repeatedly, significantly impact my ability to get stuff done, and can't be fixed without fundamental changes. \n\nA quick list of things I'm not going to cover:\n\n* Async/await: Actually fairly decent in Rust in my opinion. Pretty solid given the constraints of no extra cost or builtin runtime, cancellation, etc. I remember the pressure to get this shipped around Rust 2018 edition, and I think it came out pretty well despite that. The main issues are around mixing sync and async code, Pin, multiple executors in the ecosystem, and whether zero-cost is a sensible tradeoff to begin with. It's been discussed to death, I don't have anything to add to it. Maybe virtual threads would've been nicer and just eat the runtime costs, I don't know. I feel that just using async by itself in e.g. a web server is pretty solid now that we've gotten async traits. \n* Library ecosystem: Yeah I wished it was more stable and bug-free (e.g. comparing winit to sdl), but that's not really a language issue. There's not much for me to talk about here.\n\nOnto my complaints.\n\n# Result<T, E>\n\nWhen I first started with Rust, I loved that errors are just another type. Implicit errors are terrible; forcing the user to be aware that a function could error, and handle that error is a great design!\n\nAs I've used Rust for both library and application code over the years, I've grown more and more disillusioned with this take. \n\nAs a library author, having to make new error types and convert between them for every possible issue _sucks_. There's nothing worse than adding a dependency, calling a function from it, and then having to go figure out how to add it's own error type into your wrapper error type. Crates like `thiserror` (I think the main one I've tried) help a bit, but in my experience are still a poor experience. And that's all for 1 function - if you make a second function doing something different, you're probably going to want a whole new error type for that. \n\nThen there's application code. Usually you don't care about how/why a function failed - you just want to propagate the error up and display the end result to the user. Sure, there's `anyhow`, but this is something that languages like Java handles _way_ better in my experience. Besides the obvious issue of wanting a single dynamically dispatched type, the real issue to me is backtraces. \n\nWith Java, I see a perfect log of exactly what function first threw an error, and how that got propagated up the stack to whatever logging or display mechanism the program is using. With Rust, there's no backtraces whenever you propagate an error with the ? operator. Of course backtraces have a performance cost, which is why it's not built-in. \n\nLibraries hit this issue too - it's really hard to figure out what the issue is when a user reports a bug, as all you have is \"top level function failed\" with no backtrace, unless it's a panic. Same with tracking down why your dependencies are throwing errors themselves.\n\nRust got the \"forcing developers to think about errors\" part right. Unlike Java, it's immediately obvious that a function can fail, and you can't accidentally skip dealing with this. I've seen so many bugs in other languages where some function threw an error, and completely unwound the program when it should have been dealt with 10 layers lower with a retry. \n\nHowever, while it's zero-cost and very explicit, I think Rust made a mistake in thinking that people would care (in most cases) _why_ a function failed beyond informing the user. I really think it's time Rust standardized on a single type that acts like Box<dyn Error> (including supports for string errors), and automatically attaches context whenever it gets propagated between functions. It wouldn't be for all uses cases, as it's not zero-cost and is less explicit, but it would make sense for a lot of use cases.\n\nSmall aside, there's also error messages. Should errors be formatted like \"Error: Failed to do x.\", or \"Failed to do x\"? Period at the end? Capitalization? This is not really the language's fault, but I wish there was an ecosystem-wide standard for formatting errors.\n\n# Modules\n\nThe orphan rule sucks sometimes, and the module system is maybe too flexible. \n\nWorking on Bevy, which has a monorepo consisting of bevy_render, bevy_pbr, bevy_time, bevy_gizmos, bevy_ui, etc, and a top-level bevy crate that re-exports everything, I've felt the pain on this pretty strongly recently.\n\nOrganizing code across crates is pretty difficult. You can re-export types willy-nilly between crates, make some parts pub(crate), pub(super), or pub(crate::random::path). For imports, the same problems apply, and you can choose to re-export specific modules or types from within other modules. It's really easy to accidentally expose types you didn't mean to, or to re-export a module and lose out on the module-documentation you've written for it.\n\nMore than any real issue, it's just too much power. It's strange because Rust loves to be explicit, but gives you a _lot_ of leeway in how you arrange your types. Say what you will about Java's \"one file = one class; module paths follow filesystem folders\" approach, but it's nothing if not explicit. It's much easier to jump into a large project in Java and know exactly where a type can be found, than it is for Rust.\n\nThe orphan rule is a problem too, but something I don't have as much to say about. It just sometimes really gets in the way, even for library developers due to splitting things across crates for one project (and Rust really encourages you to split things up into multiple crates).\n\n# Compile times and IDE tooling\n\nCompile times and error checking in my IDE are too slow. People do great work speeding up rustc and rust-analyzer, and I don't mean to demean their efforts. But Rust fundamentally treats 1 crate = 1 compilation unit, and that really hurts the end-user experience. Touching one function in Bevy's monorepo means the entire crate gets recompiled, and every other crate that depends on it. I really really wish that modifying a function implementation or file was as simple as recompiling that function / file and patching the binary.\n\nRust analyzer has the same problem. IntelliJ indexes my project once on startup, and instantly shows errors for the rest of my development time. Rust analyzer feels like it's reindexing the entire project (minus dependencies) every time you type. Fine for small projects, but borderline unusable at Bevy's scale.\n\nI'm not a compiler dev - maybe these are fundamental problems that can't be fixed, especially with considerations for macros, build scripts, cargo features, and other issues. But I really wish the compiler could just maintain a graph of my project's structure and detect that I've only modified this one part. This happens all the time in UI development with the VDOM, is there any reason this can't be implemented in cargo/rustc?\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAnd that's the end of the post. Writing is not my strong suit, and this was hastily put together at night to get down some of the thoughts I've been having lately, as I don't have time to sit down and write a proper article on my rarely-used blog. Take everything I've said with the knowledge that I've only given surface-level consideration to it, and haven't looked too deeply into existing discussion around these issues.\n\nThat said, these are the major issues that have been bothering me the last few years. I'm curious to hear other peoples' thoughts on whether they face the same issues."

At that point, just use anyhow.\n\nI think there are some people that hear \"Rust has great error handling\", and think that means that you get great error messages without thinking about them, but I'm not sure there's any language that can do that. Rust doesn't give you good errors, it gives you control over errors.\n\nIn many libraries I maintain, I just have `struct Error(String, Backtrace)`, since, while there are different reasons this error can happen (i.e. different \"variants\" if it were an enum), a user of my library wouldn't necessarily want to match on this. For example, at a previous job, I maintained a library that was validating a custom cryptographic protocol. Our error enum looked like this:\n```\nenum Error {\n  MalformedData,\n  FailedToVerify,\n}\n```\n\nEach of these variants could have many different causes, for example, malformed data could be:\n - the input was not valid CBOR\n - the arrays in the CBOR had the wrong lengths\n - the data contained invalid indices into data stored somewhere else within itself\n\nAll of these could have been separate error types.\n\nSimilarly, failure to verify could have been for 1 of about 10 different reasons. But a user of the library doesn't care. They only care about whether a failure was due to the data being malformed, or just wrong.\n\nI agree with OPs complaints about backtraces. IMO they're often poorly handled, and languages with a VM often have more information floating around to at least point you to where the error happened. I'm still waiting for the \"perfect\" error crate that solves this, because it feels extremely solveable, but I can't put my finger on exactly what it would look like...\n\nRegarding the orphan rule, it's bitten me a few times, but considering the alternatives, I'm glad it's there. But I do wish there was a way to turn it off, perhaps with the consequence that it's only allowed in binaries and not libraries (or at least disable publishing such libraries to crates.io). Some way of saying \"I know what I'm doing, just use this impl\""

Touching one function in Bevy's monorepo means the entire crate gets recompiled, and every other crate that depends on it. I really really wish that modifying a function implementation or file was as simple as recompiling that function / file and patching the binary.\n\nI don't want to nit-pick here because I agree that the experience is bad, but I feel like a lot of people misunderstand Rust compilation by incorrectly comparing it to C++. I don't mean to patronize if you already understand Rust compilation very well, but hopefully this will be educational for some readers.\n\nThe Cargo profile setting `incremental = true` will try to prevent the entire crate from being recompiled when any part of it changes. Incremental compilation is enabled by default in the dev profile (plain `cargo build/test/run`). I don't see any mention of it in the bevy repo, but probably my searching is just poor. The problem with incremental compilation is that very strongly depends on CGU partitioning and whether the functions in your crate are compiled with LocalCopy (like a header) or GloballyShared (like a .o) codegen. Essentially all that matters is the total size of dirtied CGUs. If you modify some function that gets LocalCopy codegen which is also referenced by every CGU in the crate, the incremental compilation system doesn't help much. But if the current crate has a lot of CGUs and you edit a GloballyShared function, only its CGU needs to be recompiled. Most of the design of the rustc incremental compilation system focuses on caching queries and getting the query invalidation right; I think that for large projects which are doing incremental `cargo build` not `cargo check`, all the query juggling is irrelevant. The query caching is very important for `cargo check` times, but as soon as you want to generate code the most important factor is how much IR is handed off to LLVM.\n\nNone of that is about the dependencies of the changed crate.\n\nIn C++ you can modify an implementation file and just recompile that one file and re-link. In Rust, the primary reason you can't do that is that the Rust language doesn't let you separate headers and implementation. Rust still has headers, but automated. They're called rmeta files (or the rmeta section of a rlib file). Compiling a crate (in any mode other than `cargo check`) first emits an rmeta file, then an rlib file. Compilation depends on the contents of the rmeta file/section of dependencies. The problem is that any change to the source code will change the rmeta file, and Cargo/rustc only understands that means a rebuild is required. If you were constantly editing C++ headers, you'd expect to have poor incrementality... but also you'd take some kind of action to make sure you didn't need to edit headers all the time.\n\nIn addition, incrementality in Rust is very much at odds with optimizations, because CGU boundaries (which you do not have control over!) block inlining. Adding `#[inline]` is the same as moving a function to a header file; they get pasted into every CGU that uses them, every copy gets separately optimized by LLVM, and in my experience they are only deduplicated by LTO, not by normal linkage.\n\nSo I don't think the problem you're running into is \"The Rust compilation model\", it's the fact that rustc's incremental compilation system is insufficient for your workflow. The problem is not with the language, the problem is in the compiler. If the incremental compilation system understood incremental updates to dependency rmeta files and could only recompile what was changed, these muti-crate workflows would be significantly improved."

I too love Result, however, after living in a gigantic code base now for over a year, the amount of error handling boilerplate, wrapping one into another, has become beyond useless. The worst is when you want to create a closure that has more than one result type. The compiler will force you to handle the different error types and ends up defeating the point of the closure.\n\nSwift took a similar approach too, but what I like about swift is that it has type erasure built in. At each point you can decide to just “catch” the error as a generic type and deal with any error there.\n\nI’ve started adopting anyhow in my project simply because I’m exhausted playing Error typecaster. It honestly should become part of the std library.\n\nFor small projects, handling various result errors is manageable, but at some point, it’s too tedious to keep track of. Future small refactor tasks then becomes an exercise in asking yourself if it’s cheaper to rewrite the thing from scratch. \n\nResult, grew out of era of language design where “exception handling needs to be rethought.” However, it’s clear to me now that there’s a middle ground somewhere and rust went too far in the other direction."

No other language comes even close.\n\nThe *only* problem is the huge amount of boilerplate required to make new error types. This means that generally speaking, libraries don't define finer grained error types; usually just one error or a handful at most.\n\nBut this boilerplate is fixable! Libraries like `thiserror` is a stopgap measure but new language features should address this problem.\n\nFor example: there is no operator to compose errors, something like, anonymous enums (that OCaml calls polymorphic variants), or the `|` type-level operator from Typescript. This forces you to create a new error type for slight modifications to a base error type. So you can't write a bunch of foundational error types and write things like\n\n    fn f() -> Error1 | Error2 { .. }\n\nWhich could sometimes make error signatures more readable."

If you naively call \"to string\" or the equivalent in a language, you've almost certainly made a mistake because this is how you end up with 3/4/12 and now *NOBODY CAN TELL* if this is the 4th of March 2012, 3rd of April 2012, or the 4th of December 2003.\n\nI regularly see this mistake in every Linux and cloud product. All of them, all of the time do this, and *randomly* so there is zero hope of figuring out what the pattern of the mistake is and compensate for it. You basically have to have a day that's greater than 12 but not the 24th or you're screwed. What's super fun is if there's like three different date/time formats *on the same web page* because three different developers made three mistakes in the one product.\n\nIf you don't speak English natively, I guess you can just not work professionally in IT, am I right?

But that rapidly becomes a snowball of exceptions that have absolutely nothing to do with the immediate signature of your method, only the deepest grandchild of implementation.\n\nNow what you \"should\" do about this is to try to avoid propigating errors that don't make sense for the signature of your method. It's going to take a hell of a lot of code that `catch (FooBar e) {raise BazBob()}` on a case-by-case bases. If this were rust I'd say don't add to your error wrapper if you can avoid it, make sure the errors are specific to the signature of your method.\n\nBut that's not what developers do. People are lazy! Instead they just raise `RuntimeException` or `IOException`  all over the place. When libraries do this, it undermines the application's ability to do anything useful with the error at all and so **forces** the app to vomit an internal error to onto screen. At that point the library may as well simply `panic!`\n\n>you just want to propagate the error up and display the end result to the user\n\nReally?!! As an end user there's nothing worse than seeing a stack trace. I may be a dev and know what it means, but most users hate it.

So everything works in terms of a single, monomorphic error type. I had the same setup for my old C++ system. So many problems and annoyances just go away.\n\nMy argument is that if anyone is reacting to errors up stream and making decisions, then it's not an error, it's a status. So I don't need to have all kinds of different error types with all kind of different information. And it's an unenforceable contract anyway, which is why you shouldn't do it. Nothing is going to tell you that this five layers down library stopped generating this error that you are depending on to make a decision.\n\nIt also means I can have simple macros to generate errors and logging, my logging system can use the same type and can monomorphically stream the errors to file or the log server, and the log server can stream them back in and fully understand them, not treat them like text or whatnot.\n\nI use three strategies. One is it's just an error and no value. It's an error and a value. Or it's an error plus a value enum, one of the values of which is Success<T>, and the others provide status information. So I'm not having to look at errors and decide things, they call can auto-propagate, and only statuses are things that I need to react to. \nAnd most any call that returns something like that has a trivial wrapper version that turns everything but Succcess() into an error, for callers who don't care.\n\nIt contains a call stack, so I can at key points insert some call stack info to make it clearer what path was taken if it might be ambiguous or important.\n\nIt works about as well as one can reasonably expect, though strict error handling is never simple. Of course no one will ever agree on an actual, single, monomorphic error type for Rust, so it'll never be solved in practical terms even if it could be technically. At best it'll be a blessed type erasing wrapper thingie, so the issues will never go away.\n\nI also don't have the compile time issues for the same basic reasons. I don't use big third party code with lots of proc macro stuff, or stuff like Serde that has me inserting proc macros all throughout my own code. And I don't have an almost completely generic code base, as some folks seem to. So the compile times are quite reasonable so far, though it still has a good bit of growth to come. The analyzer scan will become a problem for me by the end I'm pretty sure."

This kind of code could just be banned from [crates.io](http://crates.io), whilst giving the rust community more freedom when using libs.\n\nThe orphan rules prevent me from using a shared type for my vector maths libs - i have to choose between that or a personal type if I want full control over it (I do) *AND* have operator overloads. I bounced on this in my codebase early on, and have a bit of residual mess in my maths traits where i was trying to hedge my bets.\n\nfields in traits could also help with this.\n\nwith the vecmath thing.. I'd want to be able to declare \"here's a type that will be x:T,y:T,z:T, i am definitely not going to add more fields to it, and i want it to be compatible with other libs x,y,z, whilst retaining full control over the functions that use it in my own codebase\".\n\nthere's various options available and all have downsides so we're back to the temptation to bounce  between them (\"ok maybe the codebase would be better if i lean on \\[T;3\\] as a storage & interop format, ok now i'll make some maths helpers that work directly on that, arghghh, now i've got 2 maths libs in my codebase..\").\n\nAnyway whilst Rust isn't perfect, and switching language has certainly cost me a lot (many years of bouncing back & forth being unsure if i'll stick with it basically delayed my projects), I think it gets more right than wrong. I have some ideas on how it could be softened a little to be less offputting to newcomers but i'm sure the team has seen similar proposals and there's many voices that would pull it in different directions."

Coredumps are of a\nmuch more value, IMHO.\n\n> With Java, I see a perfect log of exactly what function first threw an error,\n> and how that got propagated up the stack to whatever logging or display\n> mechanism the program is using. With Rust, there's no backtraces whenever you\n> propagate an error with the ? operator. \n\nAgain, errors, logs and backtraces/core dumps are very different things. If you\nwant observability, you want to have a look at the `tracing` crate for instance.\n\n> Libraries hit this issue too - it's really hard to figure out what the issue\n> is when a user reports a bug, as all you have is \"top level function failed\"\n> with no backtrace, unless it's a panic. Same with tracking down why your\n> dependencies are throwing errors themselves. \n\nRust gives you `enum` types for your errors. If the library provides poor error\nfeedback, then the errors used in the library are not descriptive enough. The\nargument you used here is actually an argument I have against Zig; since it’s\njust regular unions (not tagged ones), there is no way to attach a context to\nthe error. In Rust you can.\n\n> However, while it's zero-cost and very explicit, I think Rust made a mistake\n> in thinking that people would care (in most cases) why a function failed\n> beyond informing the user.\n\nWoah… no, not at all. I see two use cases of errors:\n\n- Error types in libraries. They are used by other programmers; dependent\n  projects. Whether they materialize to the user is entirely dependent on what\n  the caller library / application does.\n- Error types for end-user applications. Those can indeed be provided to the\n  user, but here, the type of reporting can be very different from a user to\n  another. A video game failing to fetch some assets shouldn’t provide a\n  backtrace to the gamer, and on the same spirit, it shouldn’t just bluntly say\n  “sorry, internal error.”\n\n> I really think it's time Rust standardized on a single type that acts like \n> Box<dyn Error> (including supports for string errors), and automatically \n> attaches context whenever it gets propagated between functions. It wouldn't be \n> for all uses cases, as it's not zero-cost and is less explicit, but it would \n> make sense for a lot of use cases. \n\nI disagree. And again, for tracing through your code, just use the `tracing`\nlibrary with spans etc.\n\n> Small aside, there's also error messages. Should errors be formatted like \n> \"Error: Failed to do x.\", or \"Failed to do x\"? Period at the end? \n> Capitalization? This is not really the language's fault, but I wish there was\n> an ecosystem-wide standard for formatting errors. \n\nApplication-dependent choices. It has nothing to do with the language.\n\n> The orphan rule sucks sometimes, and the module system is maybe too flexible. \n\nI agree with that and I wish we had named impls.\n\n> Rust analyzer feels like it's reindexing the entire project (minus\n> dependencies) every time you type. Fine for small projects, but borderline \n> unusable at Bevy's scale. \n\nI face similar problems at work in our monorepository. I hope they can fix that\nat some point."

      "text": "I'm super cool with people writing their own databases, but some of the performance claims here and especially comparisons with Clickhouse, look... weird. Sorry in advance for being harsh.\n\nSo just for reference, the benchmark and code, as written right now (note: very quick investigation, might be wrong in some places. I also needed to do minimal changes to run it on my Linux, as the current source has hardcoded Windows paths):\n\n- operates on a table with 10M rows (`consolidated_write_data_function(5_000_000 * 2)`, though for some sus reasons populating panics half the time, and other times produces slightly less than 10M rows),\n- the benchmark basically does a `where id > hardcoded_number` and that's it,\n- the table is row-oriented, I'm assuming the second `POINTERS` file contains offsets into each row,\n- for each of 2000 batches of 5000 (pointers to) records, spawns a Tokio task\n- inside the task, for each row pointer (plain loop), it iterates the expected columns (here hardcoded to only `id`) and copies the data to a row object, then passes this single row to the Transformer object which is basically a huge `switch` (still per-row) that decides which math operation to do on the input column value\n- EDIT: also the main iteration loop and the function that reads bytes for each row's field are async, which is also not the most perf-friendly thing in a tight loop (but probably not the worst offender here, and it doesn't actually do any async FS operations if mmap is available)\n- if the row matches the condition, it's passed via tokio mpsc channel - and the final task aggregates all the rows from the channel into one Vec at the end. It waits to start reading from channel until all parallel tasks are done (why?), so the channel temporarily stores a copy of all (matching-condition) rows.\n\nAnd that's the happy path, but I'm not going to mention what happens for non-trivial expressions or when mmap is not available or anything not involving the hardcoded microbenchmark, as I'm assuming it's all a WIP.\n\n(Also, if I change the microbenchmark condition to let more rows pass the condition (say, 4M rows), the execution time jumps a lot and memory use temporarily jumps to 12GB - weirdly high considering the input data is only 3GB and the benchmark is supposed to only read the id column, not the entire row. My guess is it could be related to the mpsc channel being a choke point?)\n\nThe work done per-row feels quite inefficient, to be honest. Admittedly you took care to avoid some (no clue if \"most\" or \"all\") repeated allocations. But still, it doesn't feel like it should take 100ms to just compare 5M ids against a constant.\n\nTo be honest, I'm mostly just miffled about your quote about Clickhouse:\n\n> By reading what Clickhouse does, if it's unordered and unoptimized, probably will take many hundreds of ms. If it's perfectly optimized probably ms. I am going to implement hash indexes, which will speed this up into the sub-ms space.\n\nCH is column-oriented (so, say, numeric ids are in a consecutive block, without per-row pointers) and running a `id > 5` or `id * 5` runs the expression on the entire block at once, with basically zero per-row overhead. (think like `dataframe_block[\"id\"] * 5` in pandas); it's designed for efficient dense scans in exactly the ways that your current high-level db design isn't.\n\nFor comparison, an example `select sum(metric) from rows where some_unindexed_column > 15` in CH shows this (after the data settles in cache, ~20x slower if uncached):\n\n    1 row in set. Elapsed: 0.119 sec. Processed 154.62 million rows, 2.32 GB (1.30 billion rows/s., 19.44 GB/s.)\n\nAnd again, I'm not bashing you for not being as fast as a production database, but throwing claims that a full scan without an index can't be faster is just weird.\n\nAdmittedly you also never actually stated if it's supposed to be used (and thus compared with others) for OLAP or OLTP, and at its current state it's hard to guess. Focusing on full scans (and some comments asking about CH) suggests OLAP, while mentioning hash indexes and ACID (and internal SmallVec optimizations for small result row counts) makes it sound more OLTP. If it's the latter, then there's probably no point talking about column storage or comparing with CH."

Even if this was just an experiment that would possibly never become a stable feature, it highlights both how powerful proc macros are today (esp. compared to similar mechanisms in other languages), and how much they tend to mask shortcomings of the language.

This attributes all bad decisions to the Rust language/culture/organization all at once. This was a bad decision by whoever decided that they should take individual initiative to remove them, but exaggerating that to the abstract Rust (or even Rust Foundation, or even Rust leadership since it was an individual) is a rhetorical move that moves further away from truth and closer towards a general lambasting that doesn't help."

These people report to a board - made up of shareholders. This model has proven to work.\n\nIt’s always fascinated me how open source projects organise themselves - often with people that are amazing technically, but lack leadership qualities needed to run a project of this size - often leading to loads of drama - it’s part of life. You just have to hope it doesn’t become too toxic.\n\nLinux model works well - there’s basically one person in charge and responsibility is delegated. It’s not ideal to have a dictatorial model - but it too - clearly works.\n\nI think models where a working group of representatives nominate the main decision maker - who then builds a team around them is a good thing. This means that lines of accountability are set. I don’t know the ins and outs of how the rust leadership is setup - but from all the emotion flying around there doesn’t seem to be a model where you can hold that leadership team accountable?\n\nA resignation achieved very little - other than raising emotional reaction higher. It may serve to get the desired result, but ultimately shouldn’t be the way you need to get the required changes."

When they have power, they'll start putting organizational roadblocks in your way, and build bigger and bigger hurdles. You'll be constantly accused of things and will have to constatntly justify yourself.\n\nAs above, so below. I've been pained by this for a while, and have been complaining about the whole \"social pressure\" strategy for a while now. Because once the whole things was normalized, of course the majority will use that open door to keep people out.\n\nI'd be happy to see some changes in approach at the top, and maybe it will happen. But after watching these mechanics for years I'm finding myself rather cynical.\n\nI applaud JT for recognizing the harmful mechanics and deliberately not being a part of them.\n\nEdit: Even in this thread, part of the mob is not looking for accountability, but for a target. The whole Rust project is accountable for their collective failings. The leadership is the group that has the power to fix things. Reddit making some persons life hell isn't a solution at all. It only makes things worse."

We generate Rust code on the fly and compile it to get as much performance as possible. We have lots of internal maths to track what goes on to build graphs and such, and making that fast is a huge task. I’d describe the system more as a virtual machine.\n\nIt’s a huge library and I’m allowed to take it in any direction I want (I do have to justify this). The thing I’m most proud of is we have 90% test coverage."

Not really Rust's strengths, but they're improving rapidly.

And also his blog post [The Problem With Single-threaded Shared Mutability](https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/17/the-problem-with-shared-mutability/), which, I think is a part of the undying Rust lore.\n\nAt least, now there's a blessed way to do the thing. And the general situation of operational semantics, i.e. what's UB and what's not, is at least a bit better than back then. Big thanks to Ralf et al. I hope that in another 8 years, the Rust community would be done with that, but that might be wishful thinking :D"

I try to limit the number of libraries I use (if I need simple stuff that I can write myself in a few lines, I will), but if I do need or want some, it's as easy as adding a dependency and done.\n\nAlso: as long as a Rust project doesn't depend on an unreachable dependency, it will almost always compile cleanly directly after cloning.

      "text": "I was literally just thinking about this yesterday. My programs are small enough that memory management in c++ is fairly easy and the GC in c# is tolerable. I just got into rust a few weeks ago and it's definitely a mainstay in my toolbelt.\n \nCargo is amazing and though I try to keep project requirements low (don't need to add a huge library for one function I can write myself), it's been super nice when I have needed to add libraries. A lot easier than in c# (NuGet works, but you still have to fiddle with dlls sometimes) and a hell of a lot easier than c++.\nRusts enums are absolutely fantastic. Using associated data covers like 80% of my use cases for polymorphism, and simplifies a lot of interfaces. Even when I'm just using a flat c-style enum, being able to add methods to it is great.\nSpeaking of enums, Option and Result are amazing uses. By simply reading a function signature you know what to expect. Option means there could be a \"null\" value and then it forces you to check, and Result for that whatever operation is being done could error. You could do something like them in c++ (std::optional does exist), but the fact they weren't there from the start means that most libraries (including the stl) don't use them. c# does have nullable objects and even values but objects are always nullable, so you can't really communicate anything with that, and you can't annotate that a function could throw an error (win for java there I suppose lol)\nTraits are interfaces and I won't hear otherwise. Amazing. Arguably the best part of OOP, being able to define common behavior, and then use those methods, not caring about what the specific implementation is.\n\"Primitives\" like integers being structs with methods is something I enjoy in c# and I enjoy it in rust too. It's not an essential thing to have, but I certainly find myself missing it in c++. \n\nRust isn't perfect, there are a few headaches, especially when I was just first learning, but it's still great. It takes some of my favorite parts from other languages and combines it into one. I'm still going to use other languages as the project dictates, but I'll probably find myself wishing for some features of rust while I do so (most likely the enums lol)."

You could also say that it is not easy - but neither is kernel development. I hoped the Kernel people would be open to change, and learning new skills, since this is something they seem to normalny enjoy.\n\nI feel like `C` has a similar problem to Rust - it also has its fanatics, who would write only in C, if possible, and reject everything else. This is especially annoying with some elitists, who think just because they write something in C, that means they are more skilled.\n\n Also, hand waving memory issues / ease of invoking UB by essentially saying it is just a \"skill issue\" is also just so annoying. Yeah, sure let's assume you are the second coming of Christ and don't make any mistakes ever. Good for you, but most people will make a very stupid mistake once in a while - since we are human. Everyone has bad days, and everyone will fail at some point.\n\nI feel like there is this idea that writing in C is hard, therefore skilled people use C, and the rest uses inefficient, High-Level languages. C is simultaneously simple(for smart people), yet difficult(for the \"normies\").\n\n\nBut - I feel like 99.9% of Rust devs could write C no problem. Writing C is not harder than writing Rust. However, admitting that Rust is in any way comparable to C makes their efforts seem silly.\n\nNormally, a lot of very vocal people brag and feel superior, because they use C, and can do stuff(like kernels, or bare-bones development) that none else can.\n\nSo, writing advanced, low-level stuff in C is like climbing Mt. Everest - a great accomplishment, to be envied by all.\n\nHowever, Rust comes along and builds stairs to the top of the mountain. Suddenly, writing fast, low-level code becomes way easier. \n\nIf this vocal minority accepts Rust as a viable alternative, then their efforts are purely performative.\n\n\n*Oh, you climbed the mountain with no safety gear?\nNice, but those folk over there took the stairs, and finished the whole journey in half the time. Oh, by the way, have you heard that the government says people should use the stairs, or at last certified gear? Yeah, they got tired of having to clean up folk who fall down.*\n\nWriting C stops being some sacred art, performed by the True Real Programers, and starts being what it really is - just writing code. \n\nThere are a lot of perfectly fine folk who just like C - and there is nothing wrong with that. *C is just a language.* However, once the small, annoying minority starts to bash other languages because they dare to not be C - we have a problem. Especially when they know nothing about Rust - is it that hard to criticize the real problems of Rust, instead of getting angry at things which are not real?\n\nWell, this got a bit ranty.  I just think people should use whatever language they like, and not hound on others for making different choices. You can disagree on technical stuff - but please, don't let non-technical issues harm open source.\n\nAlso - this rant is not targeted on anyone in particular, and more so aims at an amalgamation of bad people I encountered over the years(IRL and online)."

Even if they were generated and got regenerated, the code using those apis would break.\n\nOn the other hand, I can see how that creates a real problem for someone doing those refactorings who only knows C.  Also refactoring Rust would be difficult for them. Creating new, good bindings though is probably a more advanced skill than just writing Rust in the kernel. So I can see how it would be a practical problem.\n\nBut it's one you have to solve, otherwise you cannot introduce a new language to the kernel. Unless that language doesn't need bindings at all. But even then you'll have to refactor some code in the new language."

Once you start looking at what the alternative to the Rust situation is, it's... well, the same but in a memory-unsafe language. I see you don't have 1.5 million lines of C in your screenshot, so you avoided OpenSSL - nice! Also, cURL alone (without any dependencies) would be 400k lines of C; libnghttp2 alone would be another 150k lines, not counting its own dependencies.\n\nIt is scary to gaze into the abyss and contemplate all this complexity. And I do avoid it where I can - I try to make my projects have a low footprint, even if I have to work for it. But the only readily available alternative - and the one the vast majority of projects out there take, regardless of the programming language you end up writing - is to have this amount of complexity and code but in C instead of Rust, and that terrifies me so, so much more.\n\nP.S.

And Rust is not the only language to have them. It's just the only one to shove them in your face and ask, \"Can you deal with this?\".\n\n\nAnd that seems to be the whole point of Rust in comparison to C++. There is nothing you can in Rust that you can't in C++, but Rust continously asks you if you should be doing it.\n\nSomeone posted an article earlier in the thread that discussed how many of the real-world C projects have tons of dependencies too but they're not as obvious about it in the way Rust is.\n\n\nSo what I'm saying here is that Rust dependencies scaring you is an absolute win for Rust. Because if you are, a lot of other people will be too. Which means discussions like this, which are crucial to thinking up innovative solutions to the problem. As opposed to some languages obfuscating the problem."

      "text": "Since I started learning Rust 5 months ago, I have since replaced my full dev environment with software written in Rust.\n\nWhy? Well, I like Rust and I also love contributing to open source. I contribute features I would use myself, and I like to contributes to projects that I believe in. Not only does it keep me motivated to work on them, but also it's very fun to use something I made myself. So using software written in Rust gives me all of these opportunities.\n\nI also like to understand how the software I use actually works. So IDEs, shells, terminal emulators. What actually happens under the hood? And Rust makes it fun for me to just dig into the codebase and read\n\nSo far, I've made the following replacements:\n\n\n## Neovim → Helix (IDE)\n\nHelix is just ready to go out of the box. Everything is setup, it doesn't support plugins yet but they're not needed for me. Helix has custom keybindings and allows running TUIs inside of it like a git UI or a file manager which is extremely powerful.\n\n## Kitty → Rio (Terminal Emulator)\n\nThe other two Rust terminals I've used is Alacritty and WezTerm. I loved Alacritty for its performance, and I love WezTerm for how many features it has. Alacritty is quite conservative on features so they don't support stuff like ligatures or tabs. Rio is basically a blend of these 2 terminals, Rio uses the high-performance crates developed by Alacritty while having all the features I needed from WezTerm \n\n## Lazygit → GitUI\n\nWhile GitUI has less features than Lazygit, I still find it plenty for my use cases. It uses gitoxide under the hood (where possible) for its operations. gitoxide is a Rust implementation of Git that's making very good progress, and really a very underrated project. Already powering projects like Helix for git hunks and (hopefully soon!) inline blame.  \n\nI do find GitUI snappier than Lazygit is, in fact I experienced about 3X performance increase when undoing changes for 1,200 files so I'd say it is very promising and looking forward to seeing where it can be improved to have more a feature parity with Lazygit!\n\n## zsh → nushell\n\nnushell is very different from zsh, bash, fish and similar shells. Every command is colored and syntax highlighting comes out of the box. Traditional shells output text, whilst in nushell commands output structured data like tables and arrays, on which you can easily use high-level commands like `filter`, `map`, `first`, `reverse` etc. to operate on them.\n\nIt comes with a swiss-army knife of utility commands that fit into Nushell's model. Utilities for parsing text into structured data, as well as operating on them. The `nu` language is the most beautiful scripting language I have come across. It's like the Rust of scripting languages, in a sense. \n\nI'd say this shell is much easier to learn and is a lot more intuitive than any other shell. Also being cross-platform is a huge bonus. Nushell to Zsh is strikingly similar to what Helix is to Neovim\n\n## lf → yazi (file manager)\n\nI don't really use file managers much aside from occasionally viewing images with them, as that is very handy. However, with Helix there is a direct integration available for yazi that lets you use it like a plugin. It integrates so well and is really seamless, not requiring tmux or zellij or whatever. this made me use yazi far, far more now. I like how fast yazi is.\n\n## tmux → zellij (terminal multiplexer)\n\nI don't use terminal multiplexers often, but I appreciate that zellij has more intuitive keybindings and is easier to customize, also feels a lot snappier than tmux\n\n## sway → niri (tiling window manager + wayland compositor)\n\nI'd like to give niri a mention too. I haven't tried it as it simply doesn't work with my Nvidia 4070 GPU unfortunately but I do hope support improves for it. I've been really wanting to switch to a tiling window manager + wayland compositor but there aren't really many options in this field. Niri is also doing things the \"new way\" like Helix and Nushell are. I'm super happy to see these software not afraid of experimentation, this is exactly how things get better!\n\n---\n\nSome honorary mentions:\n- grep → ripgrep\n- find → fd\n- latex → typst\n\nSome things I hope to replace in my lifetime with pure Rust alternatives would be:\n- Operating System (Linux) → e.g. RedoxOS\n- Browser (Firefox) → e.g. Servo\n- Image Editor (Gimp and Inkscape) → e.g. Graphite.rs\n- Media Player (mpv), Video Editor (kdenlive), Recording Software (obs studio) → ??? rewriting FFMPEG in Rust is left as an exercise to the reader :)\n\n## References\n\n- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) → [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix)\n- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) → [Rio](https://github.com/raphamorim/rio)\n- [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) → [GitUI](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui)\n- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) → [nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell)\n- [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) → [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi)\n- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) → [zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij)\n- [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) → [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri)\n- [grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) → [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)\n- [find](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/) → [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)\n- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) → [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst)\n- [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/) → [RedoxOS](https://github.com/redox-os/redox)\n- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) → [Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo)\n- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) → [Graphite.rs](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite)"

      "text": "Nice writeup, I always like learning about new tools! Here are some of my thoughts:\n\n\n\n- I ended up doing the reverse of you, starting with Helix and going to Neovim. This is because Helix lacks a plugin system, and the one that they're developing uses Lisp (I havent tried Lisp yet, but what I have seen of it has incredibly ugly syntax). Its a shame, though, since I do think Helix has objectively better keybinds - maybe I'll go back once their ecosystem is more mature.\n\n\n\n- I've never heard of Rio before, but it looks really neat. It *does* use a TOML-based config whereas Western uses a Lua-based one, though I don't know how much functionality is really being lost there. Currently I use Ptyxis, though I'll need to take a look at Rio too. \n\n\n- GitUI is pretty good, does everything that I need it to. My only complaints are the lack of mouse support (old habits die hard) and the lack of confirmation when pushing a new branch, but its still a big improvement over Github Desktop. \n\n\n- I switched from Fish to Nushell recently and i have fallen in love. With previous shells, ive always felt like they were too minimalistic to use for anything other than basic commands, but with Nushell, it feels like both a great shell AND a great scripting language. 10/10. \n\n\n- I downloaded Yazi and Zellij, but havent found myself using them all that much. I just find it easier to open a new tab on my terminal, or open a GUI file manager and get the extra features it comes with. Oh well, the advantages of TUIs are probably reaching diminishing returns for me at that point anyways. \n\n\n- Niri's scrolling model is incredibly intriguing, and one I really want to try, but I find it annoying and tedious to rebuild a desktop environment from scratch. If Cosmic had a scrolling mode I'd totally use it, but no window management model is something I want enough to spend weeks of my life building a desktop around."

You said this:\n\n> Rust’s allocator looks for its metadata format at specific offsets from your pointer. If it finds glibc’s metadata instead, the best case is an immediate crash. The worst case? Silent corruption that manifests as mysterious bugs hours later.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> When Rust’s allocator looked for its metadata at a different offset, it found zeros - which by pure chance didn’t trigger an immediate crash. But the heap is now corrupted, and any subsequent allocation could fail catastrophically.\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure this is bullshit. Did you get this from AI?\n\nOn UNIX-like platforms, [Rust's standard allocator](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/library/std/src/sys/alloc/unix.rs#L6) uses `malloc` directly (or, well, `posix_memalign`, same difference), so it's entirely not surprising that Rust and C work well together, because they use the same allocator. There simply isn't such a thing as \"Rust's allocator metadata\". Arguably, there isn't even any language UB here, because it would be entirely sound to copy the stdlib's `malloc`-based `GlobalAlloc` implementation and then use it to pass heap pointers between C and Rust. (But there's no stability guarantees either, so don't actually do that.)\n\nSure, Rust *does* use a non-system allocator like `dlmalloc` on platforms without a system allocator, like wasm, and Rust *does* add some metadata for overaligned structured on Windows. But I don't think you've researched this area."

In C, the developer would have no choice; they would necessarily have to build that solution in order for the code to work. Therefore their code would be more optimized, while the Rust code might not be. \n\nWhile modern compilers are very intelligent at a micro level, in terms of macro scale implementation of different algorithms, we still have to rely on programmer intuition and intelligence to choose the most optimal algorithms to solve a given problem. When more control is given to the developer than the compiler, then a skilled developer may have the capacity to choose better algorithms and make better top-down optimizations. C's relative lack of abstraction and design pattern choices compared to rust encourages this intentional freedom, meaning C encourages a greater \"capacity\" for optimization, simply because it requires the developer to do more; they must lay every individual brick bt themselves, as opposed to simply filling up entire walls at once with concrete. Concrete is a nice material, don't get me wrong; it's proven, durable, and very structurally effective. But there are still certain situations where laying bricks is sometimes superior to using concrete, even if both are an option. A C developer will sometimes lay those bricks; a Rust developer might just choose to always use concrete, because it's the simpler solution."

I've spent hours trying to make that one tiny change.\n\nThe best part about Typst compared to LaTeX for me is the error messages. LaTeX errors are totally incomprehensible to me. When I make a mistake, correcting it consists of trial-and-error while tediously switching between my editor and the LaTeX output log file. Typsts just gives me clean error messages with spans pointing out exactly what it doesn't understand. Obviously taking a page from rustc/cargo.\n\nThe best part is, it looks like I will be able to use the Typst compiler directly in my resume generator rather than execing out to it since the Rust code is really well organized and straightforward to import as a library :)."

The fact that you released the CLI is, as I said earlier, just awesome.   \n\n\nI have started using LaTeX recently to format the reports for my classes at uni. It definitely made the job, but only after I crippled it with a lot of dependencies for all sort of things. It was rough, I didn't understand most of the things I put there. I was googling, finding a solution on StackOverflow, adapting it for my needs, and just leaving it with hope that it will always work.   \n\n\nThis is just different. It is really simple and elegant. Folks talk about some kind of magic LaTeX typesetting quality. I don't really understand it. If it looks about right, I'm happy.  \n\n\nThank you very much for this project!"

Versus our ever-complex web standard that required a large dedicated team like Mozilla to build and maintain a browser. A single dev could build a web browser from scratch in their spare time as a hobby project.

Even if all the lines on the rustc-perf benchmark suite are trending down, the experience of actual users can be that the compiler is getting slower and slower.\n\nFor example, the current compiler architecture has limited incrementality. If you keep adding new modules to a crate, the old modules will cause bigger and bigger recompiles when edited."

Its a bunch of separate, but vaguely related functions, that are situated in the same compile unit - while they *could* be split up quite easily, it'd be a logistical nightmare in the project. Any of them could be (re)compiled totally independently of any of the others\n\nSometimes I think its strange that we can't mark specific functions with eg the moral equivalent of being in a fresh TU, so that we can say \"only recompile this specific function pls\". I suspect in rust given that a crate is a TU, it'd be helpful for compile times to be able to say \"stick this function in its own compile unit\", vs having to actually split it off into its own thing Just Because\n\nI know there's some work being done on the whole cache thing in this area (that I don't know too much about), but perhaps languages need to pipe this over to users so we can fix the more egregious cases easily by hand, instead of relying on compiler vendors bending over backwards for us even more"

Things like: Many traits were defined for every sized array between 1 and 32 in length because the language was missing a core feature that allowed abstraction over integers instead of just types. Similarly, macros were abused in the standard library to spam out an insane volume of generic/repetitive code instead of using a more elegant abstraction. Then, all of that went through intermediate compilation stages that spammed out highly redundant code with the notion that \"The LLVM optimiser will fix it up anyway\". It does! *Slowly.*\n\nThe designers of other programing languages had the foresight to see this issue coming a mile off, so they made sure that their languages to had efficient parsing, parallel compilation, incremental compilation, etc... from the start.\n\nI don't mean other *modern* languages, but even languages designed the 1990s or 2000 such as Java and C#.

We don't have this because at the beginning there was no generic associated types.\n- Many methods in the standard library have incosistent API or bad names. For example, `map_or` and `map_or_else` methods on `Option`/`Result` as infamous examples. `format!` uses the long name while `dbg!` is shortened. On `char` the methods `is_*` take `char` by value, but the `is_ascii_*` take by immutable reference. \n- Mutex poisoning should not be the default\n- Use `funct[T]()` for generics instead of turbofish `funct::<T>()` \n- `#[must_use]` should have been opt-out instead of opt-in\n- `type` keyword should have a different name. `type` is a very useful identifier to have. and `type` itself is a misleading keyword, since it is just an alias."

Making common operations panic encourages people to *not* just view `Option` as line noise (like we do with `IOException` in Java)\n* What's wrong with `map_or` / `map_or_else`? Throughout the Rust API, `*_or` methods take a value and `*_or_else` ones take an `FnOnce` to produce that value. That's incredibly consistent in stdlib and beyond.\n* `dbg!` is short because it's a hack, meant to be used on a temporary basis while debugging and never committed into a repo.\n* Can't argue with the `char` inconsistency. All non-mutating, non-trait methods on a `Copy` type should generally take `self` by-value.\n* Poisoning: What do you propose instead? Thread A panicked while holding the mutex, what should other threads see?\n* Using `[]` for function generics and `<>` for struct generics would be inconsistent. If we decided to go `[]`, we should go all-in on that (like Scala) and use them for all type arguments.\n* `#[must_use]`: Same argument as with `Index`. If it's everywhere, then all you've done is train people to prefix every line of code with `let _ =` to avoid those pesky warnings.\n* `type`: Yeah, I agree. For a feature that's relatively uncommonly-used, it has an awfully important word designating it. `typealias` is fine. I don't mind a super long ugly keyword for something I don't plan to use very often. We could also reuse `typedef` since C programmers know what that means. Just as long as we *don't* call it `newtype`, since that means something different semantically in Rust-land."

I understand about 6 months worth of C. I understand if the compiler doesn't track which functions can mutate data, then you have bugs unless you yourself track things meticulously.   I work in an embedded engineering company and watch the huge review processes involved with C (and why all the coders want to switch to Rust).\n\nMy problem is as soon as you finish the chapters on functions, you start getting into the borrow checker full speed, AND you're now looking at crazy source code markups like some kind of decorators or traits buried into \\`# comments\\`, and all this function definition that's got weird unclosed-single quotes and brackets. \n\nCan anyone tell me what I am referring to, and is there a book or tutorial suite that slows this down at this very critical point? It seems like several concepts get dropped on you at once and there's an expectation of \"Don't try to understand this, we'll explain it in 1/2 to 2 chapters later\".\n\nFor reference I've done most of Rustlings, and like half of the Rustlings book, plus a zillion videos, and I have started Learn Rust In a Month of Lunches.  I\n\n\n\nt seems like one can't ease through the borrow checker docs topic without bringing in traits, generics, and all these abilities that feel overwhelming (at least in piecemeal reading and practice). My problem is I can't see a new concept introduced and let my mind \"ignore this for now; we'll explain it later\". I have to understand in order to store it.\n\n  \nI'm probably complaining.

Just choose one and start writing instead of procrastinating, it's the ide that chooses the wizard or something like that idk...\n\nedit: If you have a low-spec machine you could perhaps not use ra and compile often to see where there are problems in your code (not ideal if you are learning rust because it takes time to iterate)"

It's a shame that we've gotten to this point. These repeated issues arising in the community has me worried about the language and its future. I really enjoy writing rust, but this sort of stuff really turns me off from working with the language.

Otherwise I could burn myself by outing them, and do the whole community a favor.\n    \n    It’s really more like those 4 or 5 persons.\n    \n    And it’s not like they’re really bad people, it’s more like they tend to… use back channels rather than follow process? Or they have too many responsibilities, and are unable to fulfill all of them properly? Or maybe they don’t listen enough?\n\nWell, I dunno, if Amos is going to outgroup-ize himself anyway, why not name the one, or the four or five, people? (It'd be damn sure to stick, in that case.) Being \"really bad people\", whatever cash value that expression has, strikes me as a red herring: using backchannels rather than following the right process and not listening enough are things that make one unfit for a leadership position, and if you have too many responsibilities to fulfill them all properly, many options are open to you beyond fulfilling them improperly, especially when, again, some of those responsibilities involve leadership and high-level decisionmaking.\n\nLots of people who may or may not *actually* know who the proximate cause(s) is or are in this latest episode have declined to name them, on the grounds that the problem is, after all, institutional, and thus not ultimately down to the individual(s) in question. But institutions are made of individuals, and especially when there's no reason to believe that the project/foundation/relevant institution *will* take action (much less take action legible to the public), applying some moral suasion seems like a reasonable choice. Probably no one really wants to render themselves open to retaliation or ostracization by naming whoever was involved, but that's a different class of reason. The institution, or its successor, won't reform itself if there's no pressure on it."

I still think that slang is good - getting adopted by major developers. easy to hire people.\n\nusers want CPU like features and not willing to adapt to write code in different style. Some CPU features like memory sharing are implemented in driver but at really huge performance loss. Question is why bother with implementing something in GPU driver (because programmers wants it) if it does 30x performance drop. Another problem are GPU flushes - nvidia recommends to stay with 15 or less per frame => Expect that your GPU code will have some latency, not suitable for short tasks.\n\nNot optimal GPU code is still better than no GPU code.

Usage of the features that make Rust easier to write also tends to look like magic to anyone unfamiliar with a particular codebase - past a certain level of complexity, every Rust project essentially becomes a DSL thanks to default implementations, macros, async runtimes, unsafe code, etc. That's not unique to Rust though...

Specifically on your opinion of go and it’s “shortcomings”. \n\nI don’t agree that Go’s error handling leads to bloated code and bad maintainability. Ok maybe more LOCs but worse maintainability is just not true. As a maintainer you see exactly how every error is handled. It can be wrapped, returned directly, invoke a logger in the if err block. This leads to easier to grok code than `?`s littered everywhere. My opinion. \n\nIf you actually maintaining large codebases, and not cranking out project repos as fast as possible like you seem to allude to in your article, Go’s verbosity and “simplicity” makes it easier to read and thus easier to maintain. \n\nJust because a language lets you write code _faster_ and with less LOCs doesn’t necessarily make it a better language. \n\nTo use your own point against you, Go has implicit interfaces. There’s no `impl Foo for MyType` block. The compiler just _knows_ you satisfy the `Foo` interface. Is that not boilerplate code? Why aren’t you against that in Rust?\n\nAll in all it was an interesting article, I didn’t agree with too much and think some of Go’s design decisions mentioned are incorrectly labeled as “limitations”. But, I can appreciate the effort to write such an article and commend you for that."

I had a bit of experience with Go in the past and I have to admit that the error handling is one of the worst choices of the language. Better than throwing a callstack everywhere, I like the idea of remind the developer to handle errors, but it really bloats all the source code with that nil check that is awful.\n\nI am really liking Rust, trying to learn a bit more to not fight the borrow checker. I think that Go is easier to pick up and just do things without learning anything else, that maybe is an advantage because companies don't want or have time to let their developers learn a new language with features that they never saw in any other language.\n\nThe article was a good read. Do you find that coming with a lot of Rust background, maybe your approach was a little biased? That you were trying to do things in a Rust way while maybe a Go dev could just take a different method altogether, avoiding the limitations you mentioned?"

There's been a lot of discussion around floats on this especially, because even beyond the current issue, your host architecture which performs the compile time evaluation, and your client architecture which executes it, may not implement floats in the same way.

If I'm calling a function that could have implications on my program's final compilation output instead of its runtime behavior, I think that's something that the caller should be aware of in some manner. Forcing the function to be `unsafe` would be one way of doing that.~~ ([see this comment for rationale for striking out this text](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1g5vsb5/announcing_rust_1820_rust_blog/lseo8t4/) \\*)\n\nIt's a bit of a stretch because it would require:\n\n1. ~~A crate you legitimately want to use to export an interesting function with `#[no_mange]`~~ this isn't even required, see my own reply to this comment.\n2. A compromised crate in your dependency graph\n\nBut it seems like this could be abused for a sneaky bugdoor. If you can achieve #2 then you can definitely do worse things, so this is not the end of the world.\n\n~~If it's deeper in the code as well and not in a public API I guess I'd never notice it.

And they said I was too young (a mere teenager). While I was awful at math, I turned my school into a 3D game within a year.\n\nThe idea that Rust is hard to start with is blown out of proportion. It's simply because the on-ramp into the language is the Rust book, which references many other languages and assumes its talking to expert coders--as the foreword says. \n\nAll we need is better on-ramps and tutorials for people new to coding. A lot of what makes Rust \"hard\" is habits from previous languages that must be unlearned. For instance, IMPLs and STRUCTs are only hard if you're used to classes. Defining every type is only hard when you're used to not having to define anything (and getting in trouble for it when writing anything complex).\n\nI wish I could've started with Rust and programmed in the borrower-way in any language after."

There are plenty of videos on this subject, and from what I've seen many agree with this sentiment.\n\nIf you are looking to learn more about how software interacts with the operating system/hardware, consider writing a couple of programs in C first.  This will teach you about memory and bugs that can arise from managing it, and is also the language which lots of imperative languages base their syntax off of (to some degree or another).\n\nIf you are looking to learn how to program a computer as a complete beginner, prefer Python or JavaScript.  These languages expedite the process of writing code, and introduce you to some basic concepts that are nearly universal among all languages.\n\nI would not recommend Rust to a complete beginner, but as I myself would probably ignore my own advice and do it anyways, you should learn it if that is what you want to do!"

      "text": "The various suggestions that Rust is a worse first language than others is super frustrating. We just going to take as a given the language is hard?\n\nRust has better resources than almost any other language. In that I mean, if you pick up a random popular Rust book, it is likely to be good. There are at least 4 getting started level books (The Book, Zero to Production in Rust, the OReilly Programming Rust Book, Rust in Action) that can get you up and running and they're all good. Let me tell you finding a good C++ book is as hard as learning the language, then btw you learn a bunch of C++ then try to look at some open source repo and they've done it completely differently because idioms in that language have changed really dramatically over the years.\n\nThe difficulty is different. Rust asks that you invest time getting over the wall. Python may let you learn to do basic things quickly but it does so by hiding an awful lot and that's not inherently bad, it's different. And it's debatable whether that's good or not.\n\nLong enough ago that this was still a thing, I remember photography classes. Anyone else take one? Well they can go two ways. Some classes asked you to get a very modern camera that hides some details, and some ask you to get a 4x5 rail camera. Turns out, both approaches have merit.\n\nI wish folks would consider reframing this because this reputation that Rust has is bad. The main thing keeping folks from being successful writing Rust is that they perceive that it is hard to learn, not that it is hard to learn."

I suspect that this also corresponds to whether you often polish commits/PRs for other people to review. This especially applies to multi-commit PRs or PRs that depend on other PRs (where the base PR occasionally changes).\n\nSome examples of projects where you wouldn't often polish commits for review are dotfiles, code for (or text of) a science paper you are writing (say, your grad school thesis), developing a quick hack intended to solve a single problem. For these, if you are familiar enough with `git` and have a settled workflow, `jj`'s workflow might not be worth the inconvenience of changing one's workflow. (Though, you might still like features like `jj op restore` 😀)\n\nWe've been chatting about this on jj's Discord a bit (feel free to join, the link is in the README at https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj).\n\n-----\n\nThis theory would also match the article's conclusion (emphasis mine):\n\n> If you're a Git expert **who prides yourself on your ability to manipulate history**, I urge you to give Jujutsu a serious try on a real project."

I'd say about half the time I commit I don't commit everything that changed locally, because:\n\n* it's some weird build file change that xcode made automatically despite nothing changing in the build configuration, or\n* whitespace changes to a file that I added code to but later moved somewhere else, or\n* some other change that is for local debugging only (ie, adding a `MessageBoxA` call), or\n* some part of my changes that are better moved to a different PR to make reviewers lives easier.\n\nSo using `jj` breaks all those scenarios for me, unfortunately, and would mean that instead of selecting *what* I want to commit interactively, I have to manually go revert the things I don't want."

Each \"stage\" is such a compiler.\n\nAdditionally, since the stage2 and stage3 are byte-by-byte identical, we know that the stage2 compiler behaves exactly like the stage1 compiler(since they both produced the same output when building the Rust compiler).\n\nThis is an exciting step towards bringing Rust to more platforms.\n\nWhile the bootstrap process was only tested on x86\\_64 Linux, we plan on testing more architectures in the future. That includes some architectures not currently supported by Rust at all!\n\nDon't get me wrong - there is still **a lot** of work to do, and `cg_gcc` is not quite ready yet. Testing, bugfixes - even more testing. Still, the future is bright, and we are chugging along on a breakneck pace!\n\nKeep your eyes pealed for an aritcle with detailed bug+fix explanations :D\n\n# FAQ\n\n**Q: What about** `rustc_codegen_clr`**? Are you abandoning that project?**\n\n*A:* `cg_clr` *was put on the backburner, but is still developed. I just gave 2 Rust Week talks about it, so I am not about to kill the golden goose. There will be some updates about it soon - after the talk, somebody pointed out an easy way to support unwinding in C, and I am currently implementing that bit by bit.*\n\n**Q: Wasn't this your entire GSoC proposal? On paper, there is still a week left until your work** ***begins*****. What are you going to do now?**\n\n*A: I managed to achieve all my main goals... slightly early. I am very, very passionate about what I do(****Help, I see compilers in my dreams!****), and I have been eying this problem for some time now. So, things went better than expected. I still have* ***optional goals*** *to fulfill, and if all goes well, I will just add even more work to my list. I don't think anybody will complain about that. If you want to know about my plans, here is a* [*bucketlist*](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/421156-gsoc/topic/Project.3A.20Bootstrap.20of.20rustc.20with.20rustc_codegen_gcc/near/520068804)*.*\n\n**Q: Where can I learn more about your work?**\n\n*A: For GSoC work, this is* [*the official place*](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/421156-gsoc/topic/Project.3A.20Bootstrap.20of.20rustc.20with.20rustc_codegen_gcc/)*. I will post all updates there. Once university ends, and I start to work more regularly, I plan on posting there daily. You can also follow me on* [*Github*](https://github.com/FractalFir)*,* [*Bluesky*](https://bsky.app/profile/fractalfir.bsky.social)*. I also have a blog, with an RSS feed!

Functions are going to be used a lot, so we call it `fn`. `pub`, `mod`, `impl`, you name it. We say `use` instead of `import` because it's a keyword we use multiple times in every Rust file we write.\n\nYou'll notice that the things we _don't_ want you to use often don't get shortcuts: `unsafe` is written out as a full word, not an abbreviation, for example. `unwrap`, `expect`, and `panic!` aren't abbreviated, because we want them to stand out. `let mut` is intentionally twice as long as `let`, since you should be using immutable variables more often. `Vec::new` and `vec!` are much shorter than the other constructors like `Vec::with_capacity` (Note: also not abbreviated), since we prefer you to use those first unless you have specific needs.\n\nI have a project in Java at work, and I die a little every time I see\n```\nfinal List<Integer> weights = List.of(10, 20, 30);\n```\nwhen I *know* that it could be\n```\nlet weights = vec![10, 20, 30];\n```\nThe important parts of the line are `weights`, `10`, `20`, and `30`. To someone glancing at your code and NOT doing an in-depth code review or trying to change it, the rest is just line noise. The Rust line is 42% line noise. The Java line is 72% noise. Which one is easier to parse at a glance? How many times have you *not* written the `final` keyword on a Java local variable (or the `const` keyword on a C++ local variable), because it's added noise, even though the variable is `final`?"

The community version of Golang plugin slowly stopped pushing updates and one day, it became incompatible with newer community versions of intellij. It all started when gogland, which they renamed to goland was in EAP and eventually became a paid product. I'm sure this will happen with the Rust community plugin as well. I am glad I never used Intellij for my rust development and I was happy with vscode, rustanalyzer and lldb. They did an amazing job, intellij won't be missed."

I'm already using 1.88 beta for this.\n* Generators/coroutines\n   * I've been wanting them since 1.0. But coroutines that borrow over a yield point are very non-trivial, given Rust's core semantics. Async showed it's possible, so I'm hopeful.\n* Default fields.\n   * A big QOL/ergonomics improvement, and hopefully helps with APIs that take a lot of parameters too.\n* Finishing impl Trait\n   * I guess return type notation and impl Trait in associated types comes first, but eventually, I just want to store closures and iterators etc. in structs, and have them to have a nice type.\n* Safe(r) transmutes.\n   * More often than not I try to parse some file formats and whatnot, and having safer transmutes would be a lifesaver.\n* Polonius\n   * I still remember the sense of freedom NLL gave me! From time to time I still encounter borrowing cases that \"ought to work\", so this will be another QOL improvement.\n* CrABI / dynamic linking / FFI impromevents\n   * Multiple times I've felt that doing separately compiled plugin-like-systems could need some work.\n* Range<T>: Copy where T: Copy\n   * I want to believe! Currently using Range is often unergonomic.\n* Try blocks\n   * The current, stalled state is unfortunate. I've seen some really nice and clean error/none handling example code using try blocks\n* Generic const args\n   * I feel these will open another avenue of API design for statically checked invariants that will make people go \"oh wow I didn't realise that's even possible\"\n\nWow, a hefty list. These are all things I've felt the need for as I've been writing Rust. Then there are dreams of future capabilities such as place-based lifetimes that Niko has been writing about that would lift all kinds of restrictions of the current system, but as there's still little concreteness and buy-in, I didn't list those. I wish, though!"

      "text": "I posted about this [here on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/wellofcarse.bsky.social/post/3lmvmry2tpc22), but I thought some people in this sub might find this helpful as well. This is the story of how I got a Rust job through open source.\n\nFirst I made a list of companies to target. Most I found by searching google jobs for remote Rust jobs. After a couple months I had \\~50 small companies on my list (this would have been >100 if I was interested in large companies and crypto companies). Depending on your goals, you may find more prospects.\n\nNext I tracked down the Github orgs for each of the companies. Probably about 25-30 of the companies had open source repos with open issues. Many had open sourced parts of their core product, with clear instructions on how to contribute. This was true for both small companies and many larger companies as well.\n\nThe next step is making contributions. There is a lot to this, and there is a great book called [How to Open Source](https://howtoopensource.dev/) that can be helpful if you are new to this. One thing the book points out is that the first step in making contributions is building context. This was the hardest part for me. I read a lot of documentation and code up front. It is also important to reach out on Slack or Discord, or even file issues when you are stuck. You can demonstrate your communication skills while you're at it.\n\nWhen I opened my PRs, I was careful to not only follow contribution guidelines, but to also match the style of the existing code, leave comments when needed, and add tests. Most companies will be excited to receive high quality code. Often after 2-3 commits someone would reach out to get to know me. This is when I would start a conversation about my employment goals.\n\nMany companies have trouble hiring because it is hard to verify experience, aptitude, and communication. The great part of letting your work be your introduction is that you have already done this verification for them. This puts you far ahead of anyone that has submitted an online application.\n\nThis method worked well enough that I would do it again, and I would recommend it to anyone. I got far more interest through a few contributions than from many applications. In the end, this strategy led to my current full time Rust job."

When I was offered a job, each time I was surprised event though it made sense for both me and the company to join indeed, because I would be getting paid for what I was interested in, and company got a hire that was genuinely interested in what they are doing.\n\nSo I would say in response to some comments thinking this is some kind of a \"free labor\": You're free to pick whatever projects you want. Pick something you are genuinely interested in, do want to learn / get more familiar with, and it will benefit you greatly even if you will not get any job offers because of it. If you treat everything as a \"chore\" to get a \"job\", than you have no passion for the craft, you'll never get really good, and you'll always struggle. Maybe consider carrier that you actually enjoy. Also, remember: for an existing project accepting external contributions is additional work, since typically new contributors require a lot of help, reviewing code, etc. It's not even clear who's making who a favour."

I'm gonna test that then :)\n\nEdit: \n\nHere are some first impressions:\n\n* The game starts and runs nicely, no weird glitches or crashes so far :) And it looks pretty awesome.\n* The UI is obviously not meant for such small screens. But it's almost good. My only issue is really with the welcome text, which is too small to read.\n* Also, no controller support, which is expected from this game. It works fine with the default keyboard/mouse emulation, and the touch screen. And with some custom mapping, it could be made even better. Also, nothing is stopping me to dock my steamdeck and use a proper mouse and a keyboard.\n* I only get 42-44 FPS when the game starts, which is a bit disappointing (using the native 1280x800 resolution). The game looks pretty great, but there is hardly anything on the first screen that justifies not having 60 FPS (or more) on this hardware. Probably there is lots of room for optimizations. I also miss having the options to change quality settigs. The only thing I can do to improve my frame rate is to use scaling, and with a 0.7 value I get 60 FPS, but this is pretty blurry."

Rust is interesting though because 1) it's not stubbornly dedicated to mathematical purity and makes a lot of pragmatic choices and 2) it doesn't require a large runtime. It manages to be fairly high-level and fairly fast and fairly type-safe and fairly readable and fairly close to the metal in a way that any other language can match (or even beat in some cases) for one of those categories, but no other language comes close across all of those categories."

The bug came from the fact that  in of the uses of a structure, the wrong mutex was used, so not only did it not actually protect anything, it actually locked another structure that was supposed to be independent. \n\nSo this lead me to investigate mutex usage in the same project, and I found a structure where read access was done by locking the mutex in a method then returning a clone of the data. This would usually be a sound idea, but in this case mutable access was made by having a method obtain a lock to the mutex, then return a reference to the data. With the implicit release of the mutex this meant that writing to the structure would actually start right after the mutex was released, therefore *increasing* the risk that a read would happen at the same time as a write. \nThankfully, this was for display only data, that would be refreshed (read) far more often than it would be written to, so any incorrect value would both be rare, and quickly replaced.\n\nSo with C++ you can end up doing the exact opposite of what you meant, just because it doesn't have a borrow checker."

However, by default, it won't lint on publicly exported functions, since removing the parameter on an existing function is technically a breaking change (because users will have been calling the function with a turbofish for a now-nonexistent parameter). So, set `avoid-breaking-exported-api = false` in `clippy.toml` to allow it to lint public functions."

      "text": "Copying my answer from [last time this was asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1di33ye/comment/l910u58/)\n\nMy general impression has been 2 things:\n\n- Because Rust compiles to native assembly and doesn't use tracing garbage collection, it *on average* tends to produce higher performance code for a given problem, especially when that problem isn't bound by network i/o. Slower rust code also seems to have more low-hanging-fruit potential for easy speedups; there are countless stories of a 2x speed improvement because of an easy removal of allocations in a hot loop.\n- Because of Rust's nature as a language, it tends to attact developers who are much more obsessed with robust and correct code, relative to what we might call the median. Often this obsession comes at the cost of perfectionism or \"unreasonable time-to-ship\", but when combined with Rust's policy of \"ship a whole static binary that only dynamically links to libc\", it means that ON AVERAGE you tend to find that a particular random rust project is more likely to have fewer bugs and continue working correctly with minimal maintenence than an equivelent in a random other language (no fighting with virtual environments 2 years later, for example).\n\nIt's worth noting that both of these impressions are entirely anecdotal, and I have no data to backup my impressions of either rust software or rust developers. But since your question was about Rust's  reputation, these are my impressions of why the reputation arises."

If you claim that it does, then it seems you don't understand software development well enough, so if anything it is a mark *against* the quality of your software.\n\nIt *is* OK to mention it deeper in documentation, of course. And if it's a library, well, duh, the language chosen is kinda important.\n\nContext matters, too. If all the similar software is written in Python, then it could be important to point out that you chose a language that compiles to machine code (pros, but also some cons, perhaps?). But if you want to make a big deal out of choosing to use Rust as opposed to C++ or C, then ...

Things like simple overwrites of memory (not that rust can catch all of these by far), error path cleanups, forgetting to check error values, and use-after-free mistakes. That's why I'm wanting to see Rust get into the kernel, these types of issues just go away, allowing developers and maintainers more time to focus on the REAL bugs that happen (i.e. logic issues, race conditions, etc.)\n\n\"Made with rust\" is a strong sign your tool will have very few of those classes of problems. \"Okay, but what does that mean for a normal user? in practice?\" it usually means less random crashes and other random heisenbugs that memory issues tend to cause, and fewer serious security issues like RCE's. As a user I like when my software does not crash or give \"the hacker known as 4chan\" the ability to run code on my PC.\n\nOf course the average user probably doesnt know any of that, because it depends on knowing what Rust is and what benefits it brings, and usually only developers know that stuff, so it might as well market as \"fast, secure, reliable\". Its useful information for *developers* though, and also serves as a strong signal for a bare minimum of enforced code quality and thus ease of collaboration."

I guarantee that you'll be able to find counter examples, but my personal one counter example (nushell vs fish) isn't one anymore since fish was recently rewritten in rust...\n\nAlso, it's just not a bad thing to know the technology a project is using, as you can infer quite a lot of things from it. For example, a project written in Electron will automatically come with certain up- and downsides (like the ability to run it in the browser directly vs. potentially high memory usage).

Most of Rust cli applicaitions use clap for command line argument parsing, which is significantly more user friendly compared to anything from C/C++ land. I've only seen some applications written in Go that tended to have similar polish.\n\n* More modern/less abandoned. Since Rust is relatively new language, applications written in Rust tend to be more modern: the authors have decades of experience to draw upon (see [zellij](https://zellij.dev/tutorials/basic-functionality/) for example; the closest alternative in C/C++ land is tmux). \n\n* Furthermore, because adding new crates to projects is so easy, you can relatively easily add new functionality to your projects. As a result, applications written in Rust might be more featureful.\n\n* Rust TUI applications tend to look plain better compared to alternatives, most likely thanks to availability of high quality TUI crates (see [dua](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli) or [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi)).\n\n* Rust applications are easier to install. `cargo install` is typically all you need. Most of the time you don't need to play with `apt install` to find the right dependencies for project to compile. Once installed, the application is most likely a single binary that lives in `~/.cargo/bin` that has no external dependencies. Thus if you upgrade your OS you don't have to worry about dependencies getting broken as everything in Rust is mostly statically linked.\n\n* Great performance."

Other languages often make things easier and encourage (subtly or blatantly) on leaning on other library resources. That has a pretty significant effect on the size of the work involved vs features.\n\n2) It's going to be complex right from the start. Not because the problem becomes more complex just from being written in assembly, but because you can't leverage other's work in libraries. If you write it in assembly, \\*you\\* are responsible for every detail and you will damn well need to think about those details.\n\n3) It's likely to be fast. It won't innately be fast just because it was written in assembly, but if the person knows what they are doing, they can do a whole lot of optimizations when it comes to the details. The 'hot loop' will almost certainly get the most attention because it's very obvious to the programmer where \\*exactly\\* the real pain point sits.\n\n4) it's going to be a slog to get anything done. Since they need to keep track of every detail and work through every complexity and interaction, it's going to \\*require\\* the programmer to work through those details and keep things on the right track. Worse, any mistake is going to just be lost in the noise so they can't lean on the tools to make things simpler. They will \\*need\\* to work through things mentally.\n\nSo, we can see that a programming language definitely changes the development process and the end result. Sure, assembly is probably the most extreme example of this taken to a level of almost silliness, but it's important to note because it's only in \\*severity\\* not in \\*kind\\*.\n\nThe next step up is structured programming, something that at the time was considered controversial since it limited the options of the programmer rather significantly (what do you mean I can't make my program run in a figure eight pattern of code flow and instead have to work through a \\*stack\\* and tree structure! Do you know how many kinds of optimizations that removes! MY GOD MAN!). #snicker#\n\nup from that is procedural programming (which isn't precisely the same thing but it's related and came about at the same time and is usually lumped together)\n\netc etc etc.\n\nRust is just another leaf in this branching effort of shuffling through the computer science language research and turning it into computer engineering for programmers. It's a \\*significant\\* advancement and almost as important as structured programming in my opinion. Memory safety fixes so many of the issues that hackers and fat fingering has broken that I can't express how important it is. Almost as important is the escape hatches that let you work around many issues and in many cases while \\*keeping\\* that safety intact!   \n  \nIt's just staggering."

      "text": "I got tired of the expensive “email discovery” tools out there (think $99/month for something that guesses email patterns), so I built my own in Rust. It's called email sleuth.\n\nYou give it a name + company domain, and it:\n\n* generates common email patterns (like `j.doe@company.com`)\n* scrapes the company website for addresses\n* does SMTP verification using MX records\n* ranks & scores the most likely email\n\nFull CLI, JSON in/out, works for single contact or batch mode. MIT licensed, open-source.\n\nI don’t really know if devs will care about this kind of tool, or if sales/outreach people will even *find* it (or be willing to use a CLI tool). But for people in that weird intersection, founders, indie hackers, maybe it’ll be useful.  \n  \nThe whole thing’s written in Rust, and honestly it’s been great for this kind of project, fast HTTP scraping, parallelism, tight control over DNS and SMTP socket behavior. Also forces you to think clearly about error handling, which this kind of messy, I/O-heavy tool really needs.\n\nAnd the whole SMTP port 25 thing? Yeah, we couldn’t really solve that on local machines. Most ISPs block it, and I’m not really a networking guy, so maybe there’s a smarter workaround I missed. But for now we just run it on a GCP VM and it works fine there.\n\nAnyway, if you want to try it out or poke around the code, would love any feedback."

      "text": "So, in my opinion, often times people are talking past each other when debating the difficulty of games in Rust. Games programming is a highly multi-disciplinary field that also has quite a few \"non coders\" that need to make contributions to the code base. Rust as a \"systems\" or game engine language is excellent in my opinion. You get the typical Rust advantages of safety, great multi-threading support, Rust enums, cargo, etc. However, as you move closer to \"non coders\", that is artists, designers, and even technical artists, Rust's strictness and verbosity become a bigger and bigger disadvantage. This is why, in my opinion, Rust as the primary language a team writes \"gameplay\" code in is likely \"more difficult\" than something like C# or even a well established C++ legacy system (like Unreal). This is hardly insurmountable for a game engine, as game engines having scripting languages is a very old pattern and Rust can play nicely with essentially any other programming language. Rust's strictness is also a negative here as often a designer or artist just wants to try something out (\"throwaway code\"), which is much more time consuming in Rust than \"simpler\" alternatives. As a sidenote, I have met technical artists who are fantastic programmers and could easily conquer Rust, but learning a new programming language might not be the easiest sell to many of them."

A small game developer can perhaps start from scratch and adopt a new language as they want, but large game studios can use and evolve the same engine for years and years - as an example, Bethesda's Creation Engine being tailored to the games they make. \n\nA large studio might have, say, 150 engineers, and using Rust might impact a significant number of those to get them productive. This is a non-trivial cultural and educational shift.\nBuilding new engines is a multi-year investment (5 is not unreasonable) and a huge cost in an industry environment that tends to be lean already. \n\nIf you want to introduce it incrementally you have 2 languages on the go, which is not easy, and you have C++ to Rust, which likely means CXX... While CXX is a great help, it's also not trivial, nor really complete for what you might want.\n\nNote that you are almost always dealing with various SDKs, and those are almost always exposed in C or C++. \nYou also have to deal with the assumptions of the platforms you are shipping on, which means even more tools geared to C++.\n\nAs much as I enjoy Rust, the industry is challenging enough at the moment that few studios are going to see the value proposition vs concentrating on shipping and getting money, and actually focusing on what players want."

      "text": "As somebody who's worked in the game industry for quite a while. Rust dramatically reduces the number of paradigms/patterns that are available to you, at least without pulling your hair out. It also makes it nigh impossible to throw together some quick crap code that barely holds together to rapidly prototype an idea or whatever. Microoptimizations (which are almost always required in the hot paths that deal with the crunchiest bits) are in my experience also significantly harder to write, even when using unsafe (I guess you *could* use inline asm... still harder), and debugging/profiling tools are significantly behind the industry standard (at least, as far as I'm aware; if somebody can prove me wrong, please do!)\n\nThere's also the engine issue. Bevy's not bad, but to be blunt, it's not really even close to being competitive with UE/Unity for professional use. Maybe with Godot, which isn't really used outside indie productions, for various reasons, many of them completely unrelated to anything to do with programming (I'm not going to write a dissertation, but suffice to say if studios could skip paying royalties without it impacting the timeline and the end product too much, they would be jumping at the opportunity) \n\nYes, if you stick to Rust-friendly coding patterns, and are just developing some lightweight indie game that would run just fine on 15-year-old systems, and do all of that as a solo dev for good measure, it will be smooth sailing, no doubt. And it goes without saying, Rust also has upsides that could balance out all of the costs depending on your project's circumstances and your utility function.\n\nSo, is it harder overall? I guess that's subjective, depending on your personal experience/skills and the specifics of your project. I would say, as far as the game industry goes, 99% of the time the answer will be \"yes\". I do think one day, if a Rust-based game engine becomes mature enough, alongside other tooling, and more people in the industry become comfortable with Rust and Rust-friendly paradigms, the answer could absolutely change -- and I hope that day does come. But today, I really couldn't in good faith recommend a brand new project at work use Rust (we do use it for some libraries, by the way, works great there)"

Sure rust might have some compiles for those platforms I can find nothing publically available stating your Rust game will work on ps5 or switch. \n\nNow that you have a language you need a graphics / platform library. Which is a whole can of worms. \n\nSDL3 supports all the platforms above. I picked that for OS /platform abstraction. \n\nGraphics another grab bag. While OpenGL is easy it’s nothing like modern pipeline based graphics libraries. For this I recommend vulkan for Lin/win/steamdeck/android, metal for osx/iOS and platform specific libraries for ps5/switch/xbox. \n\nHope that helps and some."

Some of my most frustrating bugs to debug have been due to message queue systems deferring actions in game engines. Message queues separate the what from the why and make breakpoint debugging far less useful.\n\nIf you are doing this, I'd recommend including a string of the callstack at message creation time in the message itself in debug mode, so you can at least tell where a message came from. Or if that's too costly, at least a unique enum tag from each callsite. It makes debugging game message queue systems slightly less of a headache as they grow and age."

A difference of a second or two is gigantic when you're hot reloading.\n - C libs are much easier to use and most of them are the industry standard\n - If you rely on a rust wrapper or rust implementation of a c lib, it's likely a bus factor 1 open source project. I've found that you'll have to vendor and rewrite/update a lot of anything you use.\n\nPro rust:\n\n - Rust has much better error messages. You'll rarely get a side effect bug that you can get in C++ by missing a return type, not initializing a variable, etc.\n - Cargo is significantly better than anything C++ has available.\n - Rust typically works if it compiles, and typically compiles if you're not getting intellisense errors.\n - testing is easier and better\n - if you work with +1 dev or more, a lot of the benefits of C++ above are actually footguns."

No longer is it necessary to keep a mental mind map of lifecycles and lifetimes. That is the positive of rust. I just think its different. Some trivial things in C++ like collision detection require thinking about borrowing in rust, and workarounds, but because it is data driven, you become more aware of time complexity and memory access efficiency."

      "text": "(Note: This comment is more about the title than the description, and just giving some thoughts because I don't think this question have a definitive answer: each project and developer will have a different stack of choice for different reasons)\n\nTL;DR: I don't know, however, I suspect that most of Rust gamedev difficulty has more to do with ECS than Rust.\n\n\\---\n\nI'm still learning Rust and never made a game with it (yet!), however, I did made games with many different things, like WASM-4, Nelua, C#, Lua, C (in this case, a game framework on top of SDL2 and a mega-drive retro game), and a little pong with Carp (which has ownership semantics), and that with game frameworks or game engines.\n\nSo.. I don't know if using Rust is harder for making games to be honest.\n\nI mean, of course it is, in the same way C++ is also harder to make games than, say, C# with Unity or Lua with Defold, maybe harder than Rust I suppose, but that also depends on the engine being used: using C++ with Godot or O3DE is probably easier than from-scratch C++ games, because you can rely on a good ground.\n\nAlso, I certainly would write Rust instead of C++: mostly because learning Rust is easier thanks to vast official documentation; I also don't want to write CMake again (but I need to, because I use Linux and Windows), and I did at some point wished that I had ownership system when I was freeing resources by hand on the game I made last year.\n\nThat said, as someone kinda outside from the Rust world and don't follow it much closely (I used to watch with passion on the Amethyst days), it really annoys me that it seems most of Rust gamedev talk I heard is more about ECS and graphics than making games, especially because I tried ECS sometimes, and for me it was very counter intuitive: making games is about game design, game feeling, feedback.. not only about running a \"simulation\" through \"queries\" (that works well depending on the mechanics of your game).\n\n(Worth saying that I mean ECS, and not \"EC\" \\[or CES\\], like Unity and O3DE, which is fine, in fact is what I like the most)\n\nThat said, I know Bevy improved ECS, and I'm also a better programmer than when I tried ECS, so I want to give another try with it, but ECS is very far from the norm, and if I make a game with Rust (I want to!), it certainly would be with SDL3 first, just following a CES pattern.\n\nAnyway, I did had not really great experiences with ECS, and I have the suspect that most of Rust difficulty we see online has more to do with it than Rust by itself; in fact, it is becoming quite infamous, and I even saw game frameworks removing it recently.\n\nThere is, of course, the borrow checker, but I think any C++ dev also has the same lifetime problem to solve, but implicitly; at least on C hunting down why the Address Sanitizer is reporting a problem is not exactly fun, I can't say on C++.\n\nedit: typos"

      "text": "I can only comment for the area of software my company operates in, which involves backend services for solving various large scale optimization problems, mobile apps, real-time processing of signal data, some ML/AI and some websites.\n\nMy comments do not apply to low level systems (OS, embedded) or game development, or low level tools.  \n\nI picked up Rust in 2017, and have been using it on and off ever since, always kept an eye on it. I have rewritten as PoC some of our services in Rust. I am currently considering Rust for some new projects. \n\nHaving quite a few computation heavy services running, Rust would at least in theory lend itself very well to our use cases. Indeed there are many brilliant design decisions about Rust. \n\nHowever, the reasons I can't (yet) go to production with it:\n\n1. No official Google Cloud SDK, protobuf and gRPC. Google is currently working on all of those things so I expect there will be official support within a year or so (at least preview). \n2. Async is not yet ergonomic enough. There are RFCs open for everything needed to improve this, but unclear how long it will take before they make it into the language. Having an inconsistent experience or using macros to hide complexities is not good enough. \n3. Tooling around debugging, performance profiling and benchmarking is quite poor (more so on a mac). When you add async to the mix for all of them, it gets worse yet again.  \n4. Macros, while powerful, add cognitive load. They are more difficult to read, difficult to debug, need a separate crate (proc macros), are used to hide some language shortcomings in some cases or are used to create custom syntax for specific domains.\n5. Refactoring can cause a big blast radius of changes which again adds cognitive load. We deploy to production continuously a few times a day and iteration speed and feedback from users are the top priority metrics. Software is constantly evolving and changing. The most important thing is that you can change it fast with low cognitive load.  \n6. The standard library is quite thin and relies on external crates. For some things, having a highly opinionated default in the standard library that removes choice would also decreases cognitive load. \n\n  \nFor me the most important choice when choosing any technology is developer time, DX and iteration speed. Code is a means of communication and is read far more frequently than it is written. Tooling is also very important for this. \n\nWe currently use Go, and while it has a lot of shortcomings, it absolutely excels at DX and iteration speed. \n\nThe performance difference to Rust is not that big, even in low latency computation heavy services. DX and iteration speed are far more important than having to put up a few more machines. It can't be 10x or 100x slower (e.g. Python), but if it's 20% slower..or even 2x slower, it doesn't matter.  \n\nRust code is more robust and eliminates certain classes of bugs completely. However, our whole system is designed so that it keeps working even when services crash. You have to design this into any scalable system regardless of what programming language you use. On rare occasions (and it is rare) that a nil pointer makes it to production, it is trivially fixed and redeployed.\n\nI think that many of the things will be addressed in the future which will make Rust an easy default choice for us. Because all the rest of it is absolutely brilliant, and other stuff I can make a compromise on (as with anything). \n\nI really believe Rust has a very bright future."

There is also no data visualization library that quite fits our needs. Egui is actually surprisingly close for data visualization, and I will say that Rerun is an awesome project, but overall .NET is the better fit for us here.\n\nWe currently don't use Rust in the \"backend\", since :\n\n* We have a bunch of capable C++ devs and just two hobby Rustaceans.\n* Since we need to shuffle around (or have several services access) a large amount of data, we make use of shared memory via memory-mapped files for IPC at places.  We always have an eye on Arrow, but for now, we didn't have a clear need to take on the complexity overhead of adopting it. However, dealing with Windows memory mapping from Rust features a certain \"impedance mismatch\". Operations are inherently unsafe, and crates helping out with memory mapping didn't support named non-persisted shared memory out of the box when we started. We could have rolled our own, and by now, there are projects like \"winmmf\", and together with a crate to deal with SEH exceptions one could for sure make all of this work, but in general this feels like fighting Rust instead of leveraging its qualities. In C++ it's just a matter of wrapping necessary Windows API calls in a class with no other dependencies whatsoever.\n* Talking to hardware (all of it coming with C driver libraries, often with C++ example code) is still more convenient from C++; while I personally don't mind using bindgen and wrapping the result in a safe interface layer, it is more work than wrapping it in C++, and a hard sell to other people in our team.\n* Compared to C++ we are missing libraries for dealing with 3d point clouds / surface reconstruction / meshes ...\n* ... that interface with libraries like Eigen for matrix / tensor operations. Rust does have ndarray, but right around the time when we were starting our project, maintenance status was a bit worrying. C++ has a plethora of tensor libraries or even full-fledged HPC frameworks supporting heterogeneous compute (such as Kokkos), and now also std::mdspan allowing to easily write interfaces against these libraries, or to do simple things without need for a library.\n* Along the same trajectory, C++ also offers several options to leverage GPGPU, while the Rust ecosystem is still quite thin here.\n* There are parts of the code that we could write in Rust. But as long as we have to rely on C++ somewhere, it would be unwise to add another language to the mix without very good reason. Cargo is ludicrously more convenient than CMake, but CMake always wins against Cargo + CMake + an FFI boundary (or code duplication to support a shared IPC interface).\n\nSo in summary, although I like Rust a lot, I managed to join a project which still seems to be a uniquely good fit for C++.\n\nI will say, though, that if upcoming regulations (or customer compliance guidelines) make use of C++ considerably more expensive or painful, and if we find solutions for some of our library conundrums, our service-based architecture is a good fit for a piece-by-piece rewrite. Currently, influential parts of the C++ committee seem to go out of their way to push us along this direction."

He covers a bunch of areas and the final part of the talk (around 10 minutes) is about Microsoft introducing Rust in some self-contained areas in Windows.\n\nSome highlights:\n\n- Their focus is on \"killing bug classes\". More context in this post by Microsoft Research from 2019 - [A proactive approach to more secure code](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2019/07/a-proactive-approach-to-more-secure-code/).\n- They want to do this with memory safe languages, CPU architectural changes and safer language subsets. This talk focussed on memory safe languages, specifically Rust.\n- First area they've introduced Rust in - a cross platform rewrite of a font parser called DWriteCore. The team reported that parsing was \"incredibly easy\". Font shaping performance increased by 5-15% compared to the C++ version.\n- It took about 2 devs working for half a year to complete this. The speaker says this is pretty good value for an area that is notorious for security bugs.\n- Second area is the REGION data type in Win32k GDI. Currently in consumer Windows, disabled by feature flag. Will be enabled in insider builds soon. Performance has been good, some small wins for the Rust version.\n- There is now a Windows SysCall implemented in completed safe Rust.\n\nTLDR - Rust is inside the Windows Kernel, will be enabled widely soon."

I personally agree with most of the points and there's only been limited change since then. That said, I still use Rust for my personal gamedev projects despite these hurdles and I'm optimistic that the language will fix some of them over time (orphan rule, compile-time reflection, debugging perf/optimization controls).\n\nGames are big amorphous blobs of self-referential mutable data, and working that way performantly in Rust requires a paradigm shift relative to other languages like C++ or C#. The ECS paradigm is heavily favored in Rust gamedev for this reason, but ECS architectures aren't always ideal or ergonomic for every gamedev use case. As a result, you have to be fairly dedicated to using Rust to make a game in Rust. You're also missing out on mature tools ecosystems for debugging, profiling, crash dump reporting, etc. that you'd get with C++ and especially C#.\n\nIf you're comfortable making games in C++ or C#-based engines, it's difficult to justify switching to Rust. C# already offers a good portion of memory safety tools relative to Rust, and a C++ engine like Unreal also provides memory safety tools through its own garbage collector. Personally, I mostly use Rust *despite* some of its language features. In many ways I care more about cargo than Rust itself (though I do love Rust's enums and move semantics)."

While gamejams are very time constrained, I don't find Rust an impediment to making decent games. Really, the only common annoyance I still hit after a decade of Rust programming is that untyped integer literals don't coerce to floats. Also, NAlgebra is really annoying to use due to its overly complex (IMO) type hierarchy; there are simpler math libraries out there which I may switch to in the future.\n\nPreviously I used D and C++, and despite being stricter, I find Rust to be a lot more enjoyable to code in in this setting than those two other languages. I've tried Godot (via GDScript) and found the experience annoying due to the node structure and the primitive language. Perhaps with more experience I'd have a better time with Godot, but what I can say is that with a lot of Rust experience, I already have a pretty good time with Rust."

      "text": "I just want to debunk a few things that are being said about the gamedev industry. I have around 7 YOE as a C++  programmer in different industries. Almost 3 of them are in game dev, I worked at 2 AAA games and one of them I would actually call pretty complex.\n\nFirst of all, it's not true that in game dev we don't care about crashes. This is not true at all. To give an empirical example, I also worked in a critical safe industry, and I can say that the game I'm working on now treats safety more seriously. ( there are a lot of caveats here, in the critical safe project most of the logic was written in Ada, which is a safer language than C++, which was used mostly for UI ) But games do care about safety very much. If in the fist week, when game reviews starts showing up, you do not want youtubers saying that the game doesn't have good performance, or God forbid it has crashes. This can have a significant impact on how well the game does at the box office, bad reviews and a terrible first week can be fatal for some studios.\n\nThe second, it's that quick prototyping are a bit overrated and Rust is bad for game dev because of this. Prototyping in C++ is not always very as easy as people say and Rust has something rustacens call \"Rust on easy mode\", just impl Copy and Clone makes life significantly easier, and I'm sure there are more ways you can make prototyping in Rust faster. It's also very nice, that you can impl those traits in a certain file, and they will be valid only in that file ( and where it is used ), so you don't have to worry about much.\n\nA problem that I had with Rust is lack of documentation. A few weeks ago I had some free time on my hands and I tried to make a small renderer with wgpu and winit, there are 2 tutorials that use Rust, which are old and use an older version on winit. The rest of them are JS. Reading the Rust docs on wgpu would've taken me all the time that I had so I dropped it ( to be clear, I just wanted a cube that I can move, nothing fancy, just to get a feel for the API )"

Game crashes? No one dies. Game has a buffer overflow bug lurking somewhere? Just pay attention to the mods you download or servers you connect to. \n- You are either using a big game engine or doing everything from scratch. Rust is currently useless if you're using an engine or too much of a burden if you write all from scratch.\nThere's the bevy engine which is really just a framework of libraries to build games. \nReally rust is suitable for gamedev only if you love the language and belong to the \"from scratch\" tribe, i.e. if you're willing to contribute and build some of the ecosystem.\n\nIf you're a low level programmer who loves game development (or vice versa!) you'd actually probably be more comfortable in good ole C++ or Zig since you're probably do a lot of \"unsafe\"-s for that kind of code."

I'm hopeful for ECS architecture as the answer to to the questions of dependency injection & Big App state management & manipulation, but there's plenty of time left before we're truly there.\n\nBevy is still in the gamedev equivalent of the turing tarpit.

At this time, that is. \n\nBut, as the ecosystem evolves, especially as Bevy evolves, I think this will change. The ECS model in particular alleviates much of the (completely legitimate) concerns that they have. The borrow checker is a fickle beast when trying to develop in an OOP mindset, but is much more tractable when approaching things from a data oriented mindset. ECS is a great architecture for this. \n\nWe already see a handful of small but successful projects on Steam. I expect this to grow over the coming years. And once the Bevy team finally nails the Scene/UI/Editor efforts, which I have full confidence that they will, we'll see even more successful projects, and the snowball effect shall commence. \n\nI remember back in the late 90's and early 2000's when people on slashdot and the like were making similar arguments about using C++ over C and assembly. The prevailing opinion at that time was that the overhead of the virtual tables and the narrowness of early OOP made C++ a poor choice for games. That opinion has obviously turned around. I suspect that it will with Rust and ECS as well, once this model proves its advantages in the market and community. \n\nAlso, u/PhaestusFox I just want to say that you, Chris Biscardi, and Tan Tan, have provided very informative and entertaining content for Rust and Bevy game dev, and I hope it continues. If I'm right, y'all will be looked back at the OGs of the scene and will have played an important part in setting the stage for the next generation of game developers. Please keep it up!

Addressing your three proposed arguments:\n\n\n1) Correct. If you’re trying to get a job in gamedev, just learn the tools that you see job postings asking for. \n\n\n2) This probably has more to do with your familiarity with the language. Like I said, I don’t do gamedev, but comparing it to the software domains I work in— I never use untyped languages like js or python which are often heralded for having “faster iteration” or whatever. But the reality for me is I need a type system to feel comfortable understanding what I’m doing. So for me, I will always be faster writing software in a typed language like rust, go, java, whatever.  And the more rust code I write, the more I’m finding brain feels comfortable working with the rust type system. Idk where you fall on this. \n\n\n3) again, idk game dev. This might very well be true. But as more of a “systems engineer” or whatever, this sounds like a python/js take to me.  The rust ecosystem seems to be consistently growing, but in general, I don’t like the take of “no crates exist for the thing I want to do, therefore I won’t do it”.  Especially if this is a personal passion project— go learn how to write that code for yourself. Learning is the whole point!\n\n\nTLDR: I like rust. If your priority is to write rust (and you just happen to be excited about building a game for yourself) I recommend using rust. If your priority is purely game dev (and you’re only considering rust because it seems interesting in passing), I probably recommend sticking the tried and true basics."

If the community enjoys it too, we may be able to make a decent return on our efforts, and influence the gaming community positively, exactly like dead cells set out to do! \n\nThe indie community is the best community and I want to participate, and represent it where I can, and I want to do so using rust, and I'm sure I'll find like-minded people, and we could, for example, game jam to practice rust game design flows, and experiment with different styles and mechanics.\n\nI love how games like balatro, animal well, Undertale, and even things like stardew valley, and maybe not an indie game, but even cavestory, influence gaming culture and bring humanity closer towards the simple shared value of universal fun. I want to make fun, and if we can make a compelling story or a gripping gameplay loop in the process, that would be incredible.\n\nI love simple games with minimal mechanics, I really enjoy Jonathan blows style of game Dev (minus the hiatuses), in that complex gameplay should be pushed to its limits as it emerges from simple game mechanics interacting with eachother, to see what the logical consequences are, from extending those interactions as far as we can. Again baba is you is an incredible example of this. I am not aspiring to make another brilliantly new type of game, but a rogue like or a novel idle game would be fun to get our hands dirty. \n\nThat being said, I don't think rust is fully accessible for game Dev in rust to be holistically recommended currently. It echoes through the community that rust is immature and hasn't settled into its niche, with the community most often contributing to what takes their fancy, I think that has meant that some things like graphics, haven't really been fully explored in rust. That ought to be taken into consideration.\n\nSo yeah rust for game Dev is kinda like... Starting the game Dev technology journey from 1995. If you want anything fancy you'll have to invent it, or translate it directly. Both difficult.\n\nI made a sokoban game in rust though, and with a hand-coded state engine, it ran successfully, and had graphics, although hot damn they were the worst Dev graphics I've pumped out since I was 11 years old.\n\nSo yeah, I guess if you are interested, pending some study I need to accomplish over the next few days, and some big appointments in April, send me a DM, and we can brainstorm a lil, maybe we set up a \"company\" discord?"

The Rust game engines are much less mature and usable than engines they're competing against.  This will get better over time, but the ease of use and the number of different types of games you can efficiently build in Unity vs Bevy heavily favors Unity at this point in time.\n\n2. In general, the benefits of Rust apply most substantially in large projects vs small projects.  If my program is only doing two things asynchronously, then having to spend any mental energy on parallelization safety is a waste of my time as a developer.  Similar situation for strong typing and memory management.  While most successful games usually end up being fairly large codebases, most indie game WIP projects are very small at the point where they stop being developed.  For the average hobby game developer using Rust, the work required to understand all of Rust's safety features will cost them a lot more game dev time than it saves them.\n\nIn the long arc of history I think we're going to have some extremely impressive games either entirely written in Rust or using a primarily Rust backend.  I suspect such games will lean towards feeling much less sloppy and poorly crafted and buggy than games developed in C++ and Unity tend to.  This will likely at some point lead to a large adoption base in AAA studios.  We're just early in the timeline right now.  That's all."

You can also work as an independent developer in Rust (there are multiple people doing this right now).\n\nThere are plenty of people who do game dev as a hobby and work as software engineers in their normal jobs. In those cases, I think learning Rust is a great idea, and a lot more tech companies are turning to Rust.\n\n> - Rust is too strict with the borrow checker to do rapid prototyping\n\nThis is the most tired take. I personally completely disagree with it.\n\nYes, using Rust initially is hard, because you're not used to the borrow checker. You're not used to the compiler stopping you from writing bad code. But after you write Rust for a bit, you begin to understand what the borrow checker is actually checking, and why those things are good to keep in mind constantly. At that point, it no longer is in the way, and it instead helps you. \n\nAt this point, I can write Rust as fast as any other language. Sure, there's slightly more key presses than writing python, due to the syntax, but that's a small price to pay for being able to write a program that is more easily scalable. \n\n> - No crates are mature enough to have all the tools a game needs to develop a complete game \n\nI'm not sure what exactly is missing? Bevy is continually being developed, and people make games in it currently. They have a semi-regular game jam to try to expose the parts of the ecosystem that still need help and address them. \n\nSure, it's a *newer* ecosystem, so you may face a few more pain points, but I don't think there are any major gaping holes at this point."

There are still some spurious incremental invalidation occurring on items when a character is inserted/removed \"above\" them in the file, in certain conditions, so that any edit typically invalidates around ~50% of a file. Not great on a 100K LOC file, obviously.\n\n### Single-threaded front-end\n\nI believe the core issue you're hitting, however, is the one reported by Nicholas Nethercote in [July 2023](https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/07/11/back-end-parallelism-in-the-rust-compiler.html): single-threaded LLVM IR module generation.\n\nCode generation in rustc is done by:\n\n 1. Splitting the crate's code in codegen units (CGUs), based on a graph-analysis.\n 2. Generating a LLVM module for each CGU.\n 3. Handing off each LLVM module to a LLVM thread for code-generation.\n 4. Bundling it all together.\n\nSteps (1), (2) and (4) are single-threaded, only the actual LLVM code-generation is parallelized.\n\nThe symptom you witness here \"maybe 3 or 4\" cores busy for 16 codegen units, despite code generation being the bottleneck, looks suspiciously similar to what Nicholas reported in his article, and makes me think that your issue is that step (2) is not keeping up with the speed at which LLVM processes the CGUs, thus only managing to keep \"maybe 2 or 3\" LLVM threads busy at any moment in time.\n\nIt's not clear, to me, whether a module split would improve the situation, for 16 threads. I have great doubts, given how rustc can struggle to keep 16 threads busy, that it would keep 128 threads busy anyway...\n\n### Mixed solution\n\nFor improved performance, a middle-ground solution may do better.\n\nUse your own graph to separate the operators to fuse together into \"clusters\", then generate 1 crate per cluster, with 1 module per operator within each crate.\n\nThis could be worth it if some operators could really benefit from being inlined together... I guess you'd know better than I where such opportunities would arise.\n\nYou'd still want to keep the number of crates large-ish -- 256 for 128 cores, for example -- to ensure full saturation of all cores."

But here this is not even a problem, because it's just the same monolith separated into crates so that `rustc` can use all the threads. Not only that but without using any monomorphization or other features that would slow down compile times by a lot. I would assume that every single function that's been generated for this program is being used somewhere, thus actually needs to be compiled and does end up in the binary at the end.\n\nThis is honestly mind-blowing. It's kind of the perfect example to show how bad Rust's compile time is, and that there's so far no reason it couldn't be better. With the additional context provided by some comments under this thread, LLVM code seems to be abnormally slow to compile _specifically in Rust's case_ as even C++ doesn't take that long and C takes even less than that..."

      "text": "I got linked this article, so here's a response to some of it as someone who has worked a fair bit on codegen unit partitioning in the compiler.\n\n> You might wonder what about increasing codegen-units in Cargo.toml? Wouldn't that speed up these passes? In our experience, it didn't matter: It was set to the default of 16 for reported times, but we also tried values like 256 with the default LTO configuration (thin local LTO). That was somewhat confusing (as a non rustc expert). I'd love to read an explanation for this.\n\nThere are three likely causes of this.\n\nWhen functions are instantiated in codegen, they are either instantiated as GloballyShared or LocalCopy. GloballyShared items actually partition in the intuitive way. But LocalCopy items are never partitioned, and a copy of each of them is added to every codegen unit where its GloballyShared items reference it (perhaps transitively). So it's possible to end up with just a few GloballyShared items, and one of them pulls in basically the entire program's worth of LocalCopy items.\n\nThe second possible culprit is that codegen unit partitioning never breaks up modules. The compiler has a benchmark suite of dubious quality, and this heuristic serves well on the benchmark suite. But it's likely that in your case, all the compile time is taken up by one module, and CGU partitioning is just refusing to split it.\n\nThe last is that in a release build, we do thin-local LTO at the end. Though this is thin and it is local, I have seen this have very strange build time implications through interactions with the rest of the compilation pipeline. If the per-CGU optimizations don't optimize out enough code, thin-local LTO can increase build times.\n\nOne thing that you could do to investigate this is compile with 256 CGUs and `RUSTFLAGS=-Cno-prepopulate-passes --emit=llvm-ir cargo build --release` then look at what's in all the `.ll` files in `target/` (I forget where they are exactly, but they're in there and they will look like one per CGU). If there's one huge one, then the size of that CGU is probably the issue.\n\n> Of course, we can't expect linear speed-up in practice, but still 7x slower than that seems excessive\n\nIt would be very interesting to know how this overhead scales with various `-j` values. It sure does sound like contention, but if it's over system resources I'd expect you to be able to run a few builds at once without any contention."

(okay, maybe it's a bit harder if you don't know how keyword arguments work normally in python, but still) it isn't like, fundamentally very difficult to grasp – descriptors, for example, use no additional syntax at all, but they are more difficult to grasp, in my opinion – the complicated part isn't how the feature is expressed, it's what the feature actually _is_.\n\nthis argument syntax is also a product of Python's decision to make keyword arguments and position arguments interchangeable by default as opposed to being inherent to adding keyword arguments – for example in Dart it's the somewhat simpler syntax `void f(int pos_only, [int optional_pos], {int kw_only})`. \n\n> This is the type of complexity I'm okay with, and it's notable that nearly all of the complexity of rust is kind of like this. There is a little syntax sugar, like if let and let else and ?, but it's all very \"local\".

On the other hand, someone's choice to use let else is not visible outside of the function it's used in.\n\ni mean, it's not like it's _irrelevant_: if you click the little \"Source\" button in the documentation or if you're working in a team you're going to be reading their code. also, programming Rust without knowing what `?` does is just going to be painful."

I would not really claim rust to be a simple language by any means:\n- ownership enforcements can get nasty (just grep for Arc<Mutex in any large enough codebase, those are the folks that had enough and decided to go full ref counting so compiler would finally shut up)\n- distinct types for ref and mutable types, lifetime annotations, and use of generics everywhere make quite the recipe for verbose and overly abstract, making code harder to reason about\n- a lot of std types are awkward and require re-reading docs every now and then (e.g. what does RefCell do exactly again, oh right another ownership bypass with slightly different use case)\n- familiarity with standard traits is pretty much required (but derive macros often aid learning curve)\n- some traits are hard to work with and perhaps a tad over engineered (e.g. iterators)\n- let's not talk about macro_rules! and other proc macros, the developer experience there is very lacking, the syntax is ugly as well. That said it works, and it definitely has its uses, not as clean/simple as I'd have hoped though\n- the async story is well...\n- even the whole module system and namespacing is way over engineered, not surprised by the absurdly long compile times honestly \n\nAnd if they keep adding features at this pace, it's going to get C++ level of bloat in no time. This is what I usually brand as enterprise software, too many hands, too many ideas, not enough care for minimalism. Heard the saying \"the battles you choose not to fight are just as important as the ones you choose to\", same with features IMO."

I'd like to submit for your consideration Tritium ([https://tritium.legal](https://tritium.legal/)).\n\nTritium aims to bring the power of the integrated development environment (IDE) to corporate lawyers in Rust.\n\nMy name is Drew Miller, and I'm lawyer admitted to the New York bar. I have spent the last 13 years in and out of corporate transactional practice, while building side projects in various languages using vanilla Vim. One day at work, I was asked to implement a legal technology product at my firm. Of course the only product available for editing and running programs in a locked-down environment was VS Code and its friends like Puppeteer from Microsoft. I was really blown away at all of the capabilities of go-to definition and out-of-the box syntax highlighting as well as the debugger integration.\n\nI made the switch to a full IDE for my side projects immediately.\n\nAnd it hit me: why don't we have this exact same tool in corporate law?\n\nCorporate lawyers spent hours upon hours fumbling between various applications and instances of Word and Adobe. There are sub-par differencing products that make \\`patch\\` look like the future. They do this while charging you ridiculous rates.\n\nI left my practice a few months later to build Tritium. Tritium aims to be the lawyer's VS Code: an all-in-one drafting cockpit that treats a deal's entire document suite as a single, searchable, AI-enhanced workspace while remaining fast, local, and secure.\n\nTritium is implemented in pure Rust.\n\nIt is cross-platform and I'm excited for the prospect of lawyers running Linux as their daily driver. It leverages a modified version of the super fast [egui.rs](http://egui.rs) immediate-mode GUI library.\n\nDownload a copy at [https://tritium.legal/download](https://tritium.legal/download) or try out a web-only WASM preview here: [https://tritium.legal/preview](https://tritium.legal/preview) Let me know your thoughts! Your criticisms are the most important. Thank you for the time."

      "text": "Hello, love to see an IDE implemented in Rust, since I’m also designing an IDE as a hobby. I’m curious about your reasoning for using egui instead of cloning VSCode’s Electron or creating a VSCode plugin. If you needed real-time responsiveness(for example, a notetaking app) or required extensive modifications (for example, full control over telemetry or features beyond plugin capabilities), that would make sense. Was that the case?\n\nFor my project, I decided to go fully native without a GUI library, because I’m building a VSCode-based note-taking IDE that requires real-time performance and overlays a native window on top of a WebView. You can see my [WIP experiment ](https://github.com/ik1ne/Notetaking/tree/625116b8b8a5194c49f7f09f13d685cd632faad0)of overlaying an HTML canvas over the Monaco editor panel; its poor performance was the deciding factor for me."

Time to find out!\n\nI think the price point is already a solid argument ;)\n\nBoth Unity & Unreal have license fees, and are willing to substantially change their licensing models, so that using them is somewhat building on shifting sands, financially, which is tough for indie games/start-ups.\n\nSo for price-sensitive users, there's only one major name remaining: Godot.\n\nAnd I hear there's quite a few performance issue with GDScript.\n\nFactorio's rise to success is for a large part due to its _extensive_ modding community, made possible by the commitment of its developers to empower modders. It requires good-to-excellent modding performance.\n\nAnd yet, being written in C++ and using Lua for scripting... there are regularly crashes provoked by mods. Always a pain, as you may imagine.\n\nFast & safe scripting could be a huge differentiator over Godot. And I believe there's already been efforts to build a safe Lua runtime for integration effort ([Piccolo](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ci1xiy/piccolo_a_stackless_lua_interpreter_written_in/), for example)."

And, while it is objectively absurd, there can be a feeling that you yourself aren't working very hard. When you have spent most of your life powering through work tasks at times when it is difficult for your brain to handle it, working only when your brain is ready doesn't *feel* like working hard. That feeling is just a feeling—it doesn't matter if you're more than 2x more productive. Consequently, if paradoxically, work-life balance can actually get *worse* with flexible work schedules. Your work time is much more efficient and much more tolerable, and so you end up doing more of it.\n\nAs long as you have enough, always trade money for quality of life. I made a math teacher's salary for 7 years, because I loved what I did. When I went into industry I quadrupled my salary. But there are trade-offs, and now I am in a position that makes a lot less than I could make elsewhere but that gives me things—security, mission, intellectual satisfaction—that I wasn't able to find elsewhere. Don't let other people make you feel bad for taking a (relatively) low paying job, as if your job isn't as important as theirs or you can't do valuable work or any other nonsense like that. Only *you* get to decide how to value the trade-offs you make in your career.\n\nAnd remember that we are all Haves, not Have Nots. That doesn't mean that we don't have challenges in life or that our struggles aren't legitimate. Rather, we—those of us who use our brains to make a living—have jobs many other people would give their right arm to have. We don't have to worry about black lung or silicosis or any number of other risks, and even our \"low paying\" jobs make us much more than most people will ever make. We don't count our blessings enough."

But with generics now!\n- C#, I know a bit less about this, but I do know MS got serious about this since the release of Roslyn.\n\nNot getting into Swift and Kotlin, but they’re pretty good too. \n\nThe point is, it is very hard to replace any of these incumbents when they’ve all got great ecosystems, devs who know the language, jobs and importantly, they’re all actively getting better. The only languages with questionable governance are C and C++, which kinda tells you why they’re losing mind share to Zig and Rust. \n\nSo a new language has to create a new niche for itself, not simply serve an existing niche better. It needs to enable new capabilities for developers that adopt it. Mojo is trying to do that, and it’s anyone’s guess if their pitch (“like python, but performant because we take advantage of your hardware, including GPUs, to the fullest”) will resonate."

That being said, this comparison is in some ways bad: Linux is only in C (not C++) \\*and\\* Rust. The reasons for Rust going into the kernel are all about memory safety, so Zig seems a very unlikely candidate for that. Moreover, Zig is not really that well used tbth compared to Rust, let alone compared to the big boys like JS or C/C++.\n\nIn general, the number of programming languages every made numbers in the thousands if not tens of thousands. The number of widely used programming languages, however, is probably less than a hundred in history, and probably less than 15 right now. Rust is probably on both of those lists right now. No other new language is on both.\n\nThat being said, there truly are no competitors in this space. Every lang makes every other lang better, and they bring in tons of new people. In rust's dev scene, for example, there are plenty of ex C or C++ people, but quite a lot of the compiler devs are actually people who may not have worked on compilers if not for Rust. That will be true for all new languages that succeed (I would argue that is so essential that it's basically a tautology -- a new language brings new fans to programming or at least to that programming niche)."

What a lot of engineers want is not a C++ alternative but a C alternative, effectively a better C, and what that means for many people is different, so there is a lot of room in that space for solutions. Personally I want C with whole program optimization and addition of an `[[attribute]]` based theorem prover implementing things like refinement types, so that compilation can be fast and theorem proving can happen more slowly and incrementally without impacting the compilation (translation) too deeply. Fast compiles, slow verifications. With the theorem prover you can add whatever extra semantics to the language you personally want to make use of, eg if you want ownership types, add the appropriate attributes and the theorem prover will do its thing. I'd like that language to support parametric polymorphism for code generation, and namespaces and other features that C++ has, because I personally don't think the policy based design of C++ is a bad thing, mostly I want to avoid exceptions. Slow and fast are relative, and some people consider that side of C++ to kill compile times too much, but for me I expect rather slow automatic proof finding so even with monomorphization compiles would be fast as compared to verification. Some folks might want a C family language without any of those C++ features I want, but instead having a focus on rank-polymorphism and related semantics. Sky is the limit."

      "text": "I had hoped Mojo would be this language.  Unfortunately, their adoption of the [Modular: MAX & Mojo Community License](https://www.modular.com/legal/max-mojo-license) I think will kill its chances of being a better rust (or a better python).  There will be many businesses that simply will not allow it to be used, even experimentally or as a proof-of-concept, due to the terms of the license even if the work being done isn't a \"competitive activity\".\n\nIt has all the ingredients to be a rust replacer.\n\nIt has something similar to lifetimes (now called origins I believe).  It used to be similar to lifetimes, except it tracks provenance, rather than the scope of how long a lifetime is valid.  They sort of turned lifetimes on their head and made their origins last as long as the last referent was still using it.  Rather than \"is this reference still alive so others can use it?\", mojo says \"this reference is still alive until no one else is using it\".  That change greatly simplifies things and makes it easier for newbies to understand.\n\nAlthough it doesn't have Affine (or Linear) types, you are not forced to implement Move types either.  Like C++, you can choose which types are Copy-able and which are Move-able.  Their own implementation of an ownership system handles these use cases.  By not forcing \\_everything\\_ to be moveable like rust, it puts less pressure on memory.  This also means it doesn't need \\`Pin\\` like rust does for async.  Speaking of which, they are designing async and coroutines/generators from the get-go.\n\nInstead of being compiled with llvm, it is compiled with MLIR, which is \\_also\\_ the brainchild of Chris Lattner (as is the mojo language itself).  MLIR is designed to be a compiler toolkit and makes it easier for hardware vendors to write even niche or obscure parts to compile to.  Supposedly, compile times are an important aspect for MLIR so it's supposed to generate artifacts faster.\n\nThanks to MLIR, SIMD and even GPUs are first class citizens for mojo.  Unlike rust which needs a crate for SIMD, it's built into mojo.  And you don't need CUDA or ROCm either.  It even has the concept of memory spaces to shuttle memory across CPU to GPU boundaries.\n\nBut I think \\_the\\_ killer feature that could have made it more popular than rust, is being a superset of python.  By piggy backing off a super popular and easy language like python, one can gradually learn the mojo superset.  I think this is the #1 limitation of rust.  Sure, probably the majority of people using python will never even try to learn the non-dynamic highly typed and memory aware aspects of mojo, but at least the option is there.  It remains to be seen if mojo actually will be able to become a 100% superset of python, but that is their goal.\n\nI have tried at 2 different workplaces to get others interested in rust.  I even offered some training, but there was very little interest by the other engineers to learn rust.  Most of them admired it from afar, but they simply have no desire or time to learn another language.  I got more interest when I offered python training, perhaps due to its virtual necessity for AI/DL uses.  Rust's reputation for being difficult and python's for being easy to learn was also a factor, I think.\n\nI stopped keeping track of mojo around September or so once they finalized their community license, so some of my information may be out of date.  I can understand why Modular made the license they did, but I think it will not enable widespread experimentation at work.  People might use it for hobbies, but due to their non-open-source license and anti-competitive activity clause (which is basically anything related to creating an AI Infra like Modular itself), many companies will flat out bar it from even being installed without approval."

I saw tons of people criticize the video I just linked for being unrealistic and showing a code example too small or simplistic to be of any relevance, and then I read articles like this where the developer codes with exactly the bad practices that are called out in mind. That C++ code looks like it was made by a Java developer. My first immediate reaction was \"Jesus Christ\" because this pointer fest is exactly the kind of stuff I'd be happy to _not_ do in C++ precisely because I would at least have the possibility of laying things out in memory next to each other and removing pointer indirections. In Java I just can't do that because anything more complicated than primitives (including generic types) has to be an object and therefore have at least one pointer indirection.\n\nI'm also quite confused by the choice of making the lookup method return a clone of the `Object`. I don't see why it can't be a reference, that seems like cloning unnecessarily. If I only refer to the code that's been shown in the article, it would basically just be a wrapper for `HashMap::get`:\n\n    // Gets the object from the cache or reads it from the file.\n    pub fn lookup(&self, object_number: u32) -> Option<&Object> {\n        self.lookup_table.get(&object_number)\n    }\n\nand at that point if lifetimes become an issue, looking up an object twice would certainly be cheaper than cloning an object that potentially points to a string or a vec that also has to be cloned (unless the hash function is extremely slow I guess).\nAnyways, point is, I'm kinda shocked to read an article where a C++ developer, out of all kinds of developers, is surprised that having less heap allocations is better for performance.\n\nIn that optic, it's indeed good that Rust showed a better way, but I'm quite sure it can be even better than that. I suggest watching [this conference talk from the creator of Zig on practical data oriented design](https://youtu.be/IroPQ150F6c), where he shows various strategies you can apply on your program to make it drastically faster - especially when it pertains to reducing memory bandwidth.\n\n^(Complete side note that doesn't have much to do with the article, but reading \"Rust’s enums were shiny and new to me\" makes me feel kinda weird knowing [C++ could've had it but Bjarne Stroustrup refused because he thought they were bad...](https://youtu.be/wo84LFzx5nI))"

I decided to try golang, I fell in love with the language in 1 hour, rewrote our app in company time with chat gpt in less than month. Everyone in team loves the language, and it don't break my creativity, provide code safe mechanisms and so on.... It was the best idea I ever had. (App was previously in python, we had problems with performance, and complexity non well managed by duck typing - created a lot of bugs...)\n\n  \nTo answer what problem I had in rust:\n\n1. packages imports totally sucks in RUST comparing to go\n\n2. application required a lot of facade and adapter patterns, because it's multiplatform and multicloud solution - I had problem to wrap some libraries because some function are under private package.\n\n3. not enough brain capacity to learn and understand Rust in my team... (they are good developers but rust is not for them)\n\n4. Rapid development and rewrite of rust packages - incredible amount of outdated tutorials and documentation.\n\n5. Forwarding types and variables hell.\n\n6. Golang enables to create cyclic dependency inside of package - which is something you sometimes want and need  (I create simplified simulation software on the level of anylogic and I don't have so much time and budget to create so universal and abstract code to not have those dependencies). \n\n7. Incredibly weak IDE support, even rust rover was failing a lot.\n\n8. Incredible complexity of external packages - basically a lot of problem was created because some developers brute force non-usage of smart pointers, which on the end of the day creates more complexity.\n\nGolang way of coding really matched my type of thinking... I still continue in rust just in my free time. \n\nBut after doing golang style I'm more adapted to rust style (as previously from python and c++ ),  maybe with the passage of time, I could be able to write better rust backend code thanks to things I have learnt in golang."

However, if it wasn't for the type strictness, I'd have gone insane already.\n\nAlso, use graphql. I really can't find a reason why you shouldn't. I use async-graphql and essentially you forget about the \"web server\" concept. For the front-end, Rust is simply not there yet.

So I have to work with a lot of conditional compilation and I haven't yet figured out a clean way to structure my code yet.\n\nAnyway this is no problem for your usecase anyways.

This means if you ever used let's say SQLite, DuckDB, Apache Spark etc. You won't need them anymore.

Professionally I have been using Rust daily for general backend services (HTTP and otherwise), as well as some closed source WASM front ends for a few years now. I'd say for verbosity, it's *far less* verbose than Go if you're using a lot of crates and even light frameworks. In the case of building your classic REST API, one can choose to use some common crates like SQLx, Axum, thiserror, and utopia together. This will give you a very feature rich, easier to build, cleaner code version of my old Go counter parts, but you'll also be leveraging a ton of derive and proc macros which is the real magic behind some of those crates. If you're intending to avoid these things (debatable for learning, but in the long term you shouldn't) then yes, it will get very tedious and boilerplate-y.\n\nGo is nice because you can do so much and easily without a ton of magic/additional layers, it's wonderful in that regard. But if you're looking for a robust type system, say no more and just dive in. It may take you a bit to get over the hump that is understanding the borrow checker and what it expects of you, but I say postpone your decision to stick with it until you get over that hurdle.\n\nAfter that, you'll still run into snags here, dumping time into things that feel a bit unnecessary and annoying, but overall you'll spend far less time debugging and chasing down areas where you hacked things to get them to work with an aging TODO on them. I think this is part that people fail to recognize getting started with Rust. You're going to deal with a lot of \"issues\" up front that you can ignore or just don't deal with at all in other languages and this can be demoralizing if you're not used to the concepts that Rust was designed for. If you power through it, there's a good chance you'll enjoy the language, even for web stuff."

From my point of view Rust is a general purpose programming language with strong systems programming capabilities, and Zig is a systems programming language with lots of features which are absolutely redundant for general purpose programming. So in my opinion they are not like the same type of thing to compare so generally. Zig outshines Rust in some aspects of systems programming in terms of precise control and transparency... which is really needed only in a small subset of programming tasks.\n\nSome other aspects I don't like in Zig:\n\n1. comptime trickery feels a bit like C++ templates with all that unrestricted power, but I'm not familiar with Zig enough to judge if this feature can lead to the same amount of problems\n2. \"Safe enough\" isn't enough for me, and if tests could prevent all the rest memory safety issues, even assembly could be considered as memory safe language\n3. With Rust I feel myself backed from all sides: from tooling to type system, so I can focus on solving the task I'm interested in, and don't have to worry about forgotten defers or some other manual resource management stuff\n4. The syntax of Zig feels a bit inconsistent, alien, and kinda \"made up\" for me, and I'm also not a huge fan of camel case, but it is a matter of personal taste\n5. The Rust way of programming with all its strict aliasing rules feels natural for me, and I don't fight the borrow checker, so the main reason why lots of people feel Zig more simple and \"fun\" doesn't work for me. Maybe, if I worked with some very low level stuff, I would prefer Zig, rather than dealing with the complexity of unsafe Rust, but I'm not sure"

      "text": "I fall into the “prefers rust” camp. I’ve thought about this off and on actually and I find it hard to quantify exactly why I don’t like zig more. I’ve been a C developer since 2017. Very often I see people praise zig as similar to C but with modern conveniences. I’ve never felt that way while writing zig. To me it feels more like a modern language with the inconveniences of C (manual memory management, nullness, raw pointers). \n\nZig has interesting features but it feels almost like a research project or someone experimenting with a language. Rust’s design feels more cohesive, thoughtful, and ergonomic to me.\n\nSome specific things about zig that made me enjoy it less:\n- the deliberateness of memory management is better than C, but having to pass around an allocator practically everywhere is cumbersome. It also causes confusion when using libraries about who owns the data. I spent a not insignificant amount of time debugging StringHashMap issues because I assumed it would allocate keys. It doesn’t. You initialize the struct with an allocator, but that is only used for certain internal operations, not all memory associated with the hash map. With Rust you don’t have to think about allocations, which is huge once you get used to it. \n- the syntax feels bloated to me. There are lots of symbols and patterns to remember. Import syntax, capture groups, pointers and slices, labels, anonymous struct literals, optionals, error unions, probably others I’m forgetting all have their own symbols and subtly different syntax to remember. It’s probably just a me thing, but they’re all similar to other languages but just different enough that it confuses me\n- probably because zig is so dedicated to ffi, it has to address null-ness and initialization of variables. Zig also adds its own features with optionals and errors. This results in having to deal with so many possibilities for the state of a variable. Is it an optional? Is it null? Is it undefined? Is it an error union? Rust’s Option and Result feel easier to use, more concise, and better thought out. Plus you get context with Rust’s result vs zig’s error\n- I don’t like anytype or zig’s implementation of polymorphism. It feels like something that was added later to the language and is hard to use and write. I thought Rust’s traits and preference for composition were limiting when I first started learning Rust. But I’ve come to appreciate the simplicity it brings. `Box<dyn …>` is weird but eventually makes sense. It’s also not that common. anytype and manual vtables are common in the std library. \n- minor thing but I just prefer snake case\n- cargo is so polished, adding dependencies is so easy. Mucking with build.zig isn’t hard but still an exercise (especially when documentation goes stale with a zig version bump)\n\nOverall, Rust feels like a more succinct language, with a nicer syntax, more ergonomic patterns, and compile-time memory management. I know the borrow checker and Rust’s memory model are a meme at this point but after writing Rust for awhile it feels really strange to use a modern language that requires manual memory management and uses null values."

Because that is *usually* the main motivator of these sorts of questions.\n\nRust and Zig have different goals and philosophies.

Both languages are \"good\" in the sense that they accomplish a lot of their design goals.\n\nIf you go and look at Zig's sales pitch, I think they do a really good job of explaining why you might want to use Zig. But their argument for why you might want to use Zig instead of Rust gives away exactly why some of us are going to prefer Rust; Rust is kind of a kitchen sink language AND it's pretty rigid about how it wants you to do things, which at least from my perspective is a big part of why it's really good when your highest ideal is writing production code in a large codebase."

And generally you’re not sacrificing meaningful performance for that unlike GC’d languages. \n\nZig has powerful tools, some of which are superior to Rust, but it doesn’t offer the same level of guarantees for composability or scalability. The safety guardrails of Rust become a huge boon when composing a lot of things created by different people together. You don’t “feel” that when you’re making an isolated application and comparing the elegance of Zig’s comptime to the complexity of Rust proc macros, so it’s understandable why some people prefer Zig. \n\nBut one of the reasons I really prefer Rust is the ability to say “I made this thing that will be very difficult to misuse, even if it’s being used in ways I didn’t originally expect or intend”. You pay for that a bit in language complexity, but it’s not a bad trade.\n\nAll that said I think Zig is an important project and I want to see it mature and grow.

It depends on the surface of your unsafety. For me I was dealing with writing a rust DLL injected into a C++ program for the purposes of adding runtime instrumentation to this program. This isn’t a situation like writing your own embedded systems where your surface of unsafety is small and you can deal with them then build up your safe abstractions over them. No, every single thing you’re doing is fundamentally unsafe. \n\nYou need global mutable state, as your functions will be called from execution context you don’t always control directly (typically you’re hooking individual functions). For my final goals I needed to write an allocator that would play nicely with C++ (basically you want to hook Malloc so you can track all the C++ heap allocated objects). You’re dealing with and modifying raw pointers freely, and you often need to write custom naked function assembly routines whenever you’re dealing with hooking something the C++ compiler generated some weird calling convention for.\n\nThe lack of inheritance can be obnoxious when you are dealing with code that is directly modeled on inheritance. It doesn’t matter if inheritance is bad. It certainly isn’t bad when what you’re trying to do is manipulate polymorphic code. So you need to generate various completely distinct structures as the C++ program you’re interacting with blows up various objects into variants of different alignments and inheritances that each require their own unique structure. \n\nRust’s hostility to generic behavior is also obnoxious. You’ll often find yourself wanting to model generic behavior with enums and/or traits, the former of which is not much better than not having the behavior be generic at all. The lack of metaprogramming power of generics is notable. Because I didn’t want to learn proc macros at the time, I found myself simply lacking the expressive power of C++ MTP. Speaking of things rust randomly just lacks that is useful in these contexts: placement new.\n\nIf I was making a low level program that I controlled and didn’t have extensive requirements to interact with C++/C code regularly, in unsafe contexts, rust is my choice. In the kinds of context you would use zig I would even argue that it is often actually worse than C++."

In languages without RAII, resource management quickly becomes tedious and error-prone—you end up adding manual flags to guard against double-closes or use-after-close bugs, which not only clutters your API but also incurs unnecessary runtime overhead. Raw pointers, by contrast, tell you nothing about whether they own, borrow, or merely reference some data, how long that data will live, or whether it’s thread-safe. Idiomatic safe Rust forces you to declare ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes up front, resulting in code that’s both safe and self-documenting—and that, in turn, makes maintenance and reviews far simpler."

Also I \"paid my learning taxes\" a long time ago in Rust, so I don't feel a lot of the frustrations that drive people away. That said, when I tried Zig:\n\n- I missed destructors. `defer` is better than nothing, but it still feels easy to forget it or screw it up somehow and leak resources. Maintaining `deinit()` methods over time also seemed like it would be error-prone. Whenever you add a field that needs cleanup, you also need to add logic to your `deinit()` method, and there doesn't seem to be any static analysis that helps you notice if you forget. (I would love it for an experienced Ziguana to correct me here.) Similarly, if type `Foo` starts out not owning any resources, and then later it gains a `deinit()`, every other type that contains a `Foo` needs to be updated. Rust has some friction here too -- adding `Drop` to a type that didn't previously implement it can be backwards-incompatible -- but the type system puts most of the problems in your face instead of making them runtime bugs.\n- I missed move semantics. Imagine any function that creates a `Foo` object, does some fallible operation with it, and then inserts it into a container. If the first operations fails, we probably want to clean up the `Foo` before returning the error. But if something fails after insertion, we *must not* clean up the `Foo`, because the container owns it now. The `defer`/`errdefer` distinction is nice for common cases, but more complicated cases have to fall back to doing cleanup the old-fashioned C way, where each exit point has its own cleanup written and maintained by hand. Move semantics are able to handle complicated cases much more smoothly. (Sometimes [so smoothly it makes me nervous](https://youtu.be/OQTwvycftJU?t=1897).)\n- I use multithreading a lot in Rust, and it's one of Rust's greatest strengths. IIUC, the Zig multithreading story is similar to most other imperative languages: you just need to be careful and not make any mistakes. And note that Rust's multithreading story is [tightly intertwined with the borrow checker](https://youtu.be/IPmRDS0OSxM?t=4868).\n- I agree with @matklad's take [here](https://matklad.github.io/2023/03/26/zig-and-rust.html) about how Zig seems great for writing an application where you plan on scrutinizing every single allocation, but not great for writing library code where you want to design something fool-proof for lots of different callers you'll never meet. Personally I like writing library code. Applications in the real world also have [a tendency to grow and grow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski#Zawinski's_Law), and eventually there are enough developers that some of them never meet each other, so I think solving \"library problems\" ultimately makes everything scale better."

Maybe I'll come back to it in 2030 when it's had more time to cook and see if the lead dev has cooled it.\n\n\"No operator overloading, because a developer might use it in a way I don't like.\" Ok, so if I'm developing an algebraic type that features addition, subtraction, and multiplication I can either choose between a language that lets me write \"a+b*c\" and I get the operator precedence I want, or I have to write \"a.plus(b.mul(c))\" which is harder to parse.\n\nRust is opinionated about memory safety, but it has unsafe blocks to bypass the language's restrictions when you know you need to. So even in the places where Rust is most opinionated, there are usually workarounds available.\n\nZig's opinions have no workarounds. Tabs? No, you have to obey Andrew Kelley's opinions, and he refuses to compile tabs. Futzing around with refactoring code and you leave an unused variable during testing? Andrew Kelley hates that."

Mistakes were made, and it's heartening to see you acknowledging them and promising to correct them. It's a sign of growth, humility, and strength.  \nThat said, apologies only mean so much without substantive action to back them up. It seems like the team is taking steps towards institutional changes to prevent this from happening again, which is certainly encouraging. I particularly appreciate the emphasis on clear communication and decision-making procedures. These are critical elements in any organization, particularly in a complex, open-source project such as Rust.  \nImplementing a strict consensus rule could go a long way in avoiding any ambiguity in decision-making. This can create a safer, more inclusive, and more respectful environment for everyone involved. It is also crucial to ensure that individuals feel heard and that their input is valued.  \nHowever, changing structures isn't enough. The culture of an organisation plays a significant role in how people behave within it. An environment that enables or excuses poor judgment and communication needs addressing, perhaps with more training, clearer expectations around conduct, or better processes for holding people accountable.  \nThe individuals who made the initial decision may be stepping back, but it's also crucial to examine how such a decision came to be made in the first place. What pressures, misunderstandings, or biases led to this situation? Identifying and addressing these underlying issues will help prevent similar situations in the future.  \nI hope that this situation acts as a turning point for the Rust project leadership, ushering in an era of more inclusive, respectful, and transparent governance. Many in the community are likely looking to see how this unfolds, so I encourage you to keep communicating openly about your progress and any further changes you make. This will help to rebuild trust and strengthen the community."

Currently, is there no one who is primarily (or solely) responsible for managing group organization, the communication process, and documenting official decisions? If you were meeting IRL, this would be the chairperson who called on people to speak, putting motions to a vote, and recorded the decisions in the official minutes.\n3. What is making having a bare bones process so hard? These are solved problems with off the shelf starting points and legal requirements that set a minimum baseline. Yet even that baseline doesn't appear to be met here.\n4.

Look to any smallish nonprofit board and you’ll see the practices are pretty straightforward. All sorts of async communication can happen, but binding decisions are made in synchronous meetings with a quorum present, or (in unusual circumstances) by an asynchronous email vote or similar, again requiring a quorum. Meetings are minuted, not verbatim but as a synopsis, by a dedicated clerk or secretary. (This is less important for less formal working groups and very important for decision-making leadership groups). If there’s something sensitive that needs to be discussed and not minuted, the group votes to go into executive session. \n\nIf these (IMO very basic) practices were in place this situation literally couldn’t have happened; or if it did, it would be extremely clear what had gone wrong, in a way it has not been. \n\nAgain, I don’t mean to minimize the cultural and personal shifts that may be necessary in getting from the present to a better system. It’s just that it’s basically a solved problem, so it’s kind of baffling to see the organizational technologies that have existed for centuries simply not being used."

Private chats on Zulip or whatever aint it.\n\nBut, I don't think everybody should throw themselves under the bus over it; all the resignations and walking away is just going to make it take longer to get those processes in place, probably.\n\nAnd, the people who are less inclined to take responsibility for their own part in this mess (and previous similar messes caused by backroom decision-making and lack of transparency) will be the ones who end up making all the decisions. I'm not suggesting the remaining folks aren't capable or have bad intentions; just that at least a few people with good intentions have felt the need to leave (not just in this brouhaha, but previous ones for some of the same reasons).\n\nAs an outsider, I see a lot of drama around aspects of the project that should be boring.

Working with ASTs to do procedural macros is horrible, because they try to kind of fake polymorphism, and it doesn’t work, and what would be trivial in other languages is just a mess. (So these are the original rust developers. And they try their best and cannot do it in rust).\n\n- tasks where you have many lists of references to subsets of the same mutable objects (without losing sanity).\n\n- exception handling\n\n- generators\n\n- compile just one source files\n\n- transparently run your program on GPU if available (like Mojo, Taichi, Numba)\n\n- refactor functions wherever you want (eg you cannot just move the code that deals with a variant of an enum into a function, as you cannot pass a variant as a parameter)\n\n- do higher order function stuff like in haskell\n\n- introspection\n\n- not getting pwned by supply chain attacks"

For some good reasons, mind you, but it would be nice if there was a safe, sound, idiomatic mechanism.\n\nAnd yes, I know many of you say \"redesign your code to not need it\", but one does not always own one's code, especially in Rust, where even the simplest programs end up having 1,000,000 crate dependencies. It's easy to come up with use cases for which there is simply no workaround.\n\nThere are some pretty good community solutions! I like [self_cell](https://docs.rs/self_cell/latest/self_cell/) a lot, but it doesn't support async. [Ouroboros](https://docs.rs/ouroboros/latest/ouroboros/) does, but it feels like overkill. And new crates pop up all the time, with new ways of thinking about this challenging problem.\n\nBut, come on. We need a standard, idiomatic way to do this very, very common thing in Rust."

As somoeone who also uses Python to do data analysis sometimes that's huge -- and an achilles heel of terminal workflows (I used to be a big nvim & helix user) -- they don't play with general images nicely so plotting and data tend to be quite difficult.  Helix also doesn't have much integration with LLMs.  There's enough boilerplate and syntax in the world that having nice LLM integration is a meaningful get and Zed is very good at that.\n\nZed is also, to my surprise, very good for collaboration.)"

      "text": "EDIT: Thanks for the gold. I humbly request that people don't award this post further; I don't think it's a good look to be cheering on criticism of a policy proposal like this.\n\nI'm replicating my response in its entirety here. TL;DR up front: this document has specific problems, but also one big problem, which is that while I like and trust many individuals within the foundation, I do not trust the Foundation as an entity, because those people can be replaced. The Foundation cannot have this level of power, and it's concerning that you're seeking it.\n\nSpecific criticisms first.\n\n- The idea of referring to \"the Dungeness compiler for Rust\" makes about as much sense as the \"GNU Compiler for C\" or the \"PyPy compiler for Python\". PyPy is a Python compiler, GCC is a C compiler, and gcc-rs is a Rust compiler, not a \"compiler for Rust\". This requirement is frivolous and does not meaningfully improve clarity.\n\n- 4.3.1 appears to prohibit library names such as \"<format>-rust\", \"rust-<existing library>\", and \"<operation>-rust\". This strikes me as, among other things, completely incongruous with reality; off the top of my head, this would impose a serious burden on intellij-rust, rust-rocksdb, Steven Fackler's openssl-rust and rust-postgres, rust-libp2p, Stepan Koltsov's rust-protobuf, and probably dozens of other serious and well-respected projects, not to mention hundreds of smaller projects.\n\n- 4.3.1 also prohibits the normal naming scheme of cargo subcommands, which is transparently ridiculous. Others have mentioned this so I won't go into detail.\n\n- The prohibition on using \"rust\" or \"cargo\" as part of a domain name is ridiculous for a similar reason, as others have brought up in the Reddit thread. Many projects already do this. It also seems trivially easy to circumvent (e.g., by making the site nominally Puccinia- or logistics-themed), so I'm not sure why you would include such an obviously controversial statement.\n\nThere are other specific problems, but I don't want to quibble. What I do want to say is this: the Rust Foundation *must* be, first and foremost, oriented towards the Rust community. I fail to see how the majority of these rules do anything other than place restrictions on normal community activity. As just one example, many Mastodon servers have a :rust: custom emoji, which would violate these guidelines as many are recolored. How does prohibiting those advance community interests?\n\nThe Foundation is a threat to the Rust community as much as a boon. These kind of powers must be as limited as possible for the Foundation to achieve its goals, because frankly, the Foundation's entire staff could be replaced in five years, and I have no reason to trust that the people who would take over would respect your benign intent.\n\nThank you for presenting this to the community before committing to it. I sincerely hope that you do not choose to move forward without taking the community's concerns into account in a material and significant way. Doing so would demonstrate that you are merely paying lip service to the idea of community engagement, as we feared due to the makeup of the Foundation's donors."

      "text": "Below is an overview of what I submitted in the form. This focuses on the impact of the draft, as well as some flaws. This is how I feel, and I am open to being wrong.\n\n#### Harder to recommend hiring and maintaining Rust projects\n\nSmall and large companies when they make the change to Rust, they regard the hiring pool of developers as a major factor in their decision. Rust may have fewer developers than C++ or C, but the enthusiastic community surrounding the language is an indicator that Rust is here to stay and safe to onboard developers. When the community goes from die hard love, to memes and posts about how bad it's derailing, it's a bad signal to companies, and anyone wanting to take the risks associated with that.\n\n#### It stunts community growth and enthusiasm\n\nThere are countless of creators and enjoyers of the language that spawn new domains, groups, discord channels, and conferences all over the world. The fact that they *could* shut these down is a disaster. It's not that they won't (trust me, bro) shut it down, it's that it's explicitly written that they could. The comparisons with Nintendo are apt: they said they won't, and they did. Shocker. We don't want creators and those who educate about Rust be worried about getting sued because the size of a div. It's pretty absurd.\n\n#### Rust was built on being different, not the same\nLooking at how other languages, and open source projects went about using a restrictive trademark policy simply misses the point. Rust is a community that appealed to it being open and free to learn and create as they wish. Free to make a domain to teach Rust content. Free to host an event without approval. Free to have Rust groups with logos that are indicative of that group. Free to ...create a community.  \n\n#### Impersonating the Rust Foundation and the Rust Project\n\nFalsely stating an affiliation with the Rust Foundation and the Rust Project is a bad thing, and valid concern for protection. The Rust Foundation and the Rust Project may state their affiliation explicitly, thereby eliminating the need for an approval process. Conferences, events, discord groups, etc... that are stated to be affiliated, should be affiliated, and if not, they are in violation. This way it acts as a \"checkmark\" of validation, and any that are without the \"checkmark\" is assumed to be non-affiliated by it's omission.\n\n\n#### The Logo... Oh the Logo\n\nThis may be controversial but, there should be no restrictions on how the Rust community uses the logos. If a discord group wants to have a rainbow Rust logo, WHY do they need corporate approval? Seriously? Let the community be free to use the logos as they wish."

You should revise this no matter what else imo.\n\n>2) preventing the misuse of the trademarks in ways that harm the community and Rust users.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It owns and manages the Rust trademarks, which cover the Rust programming language and software, as developed by the Rust Project teams (the “Project”). This document, (the \"Policy\")outlines the Rust Foundation’s policy for the use of the trademarks.\n\nYou do not own the community. You own trademarks, a very specific group of IP, and that's it. (2) is vague and highly open to interpretation. Who constitutes the community? Who does not? if this document is meant to be more than just dancing around how you own the IP you own and quietly acknowledging fair use (and possibly your limited grasp there of its use) then this is just absurdly vague.Elsewhere commenters are alluding to the organization changing leadership etc. Well, codify how you want these policies and best practices to work by clarifying your own values for us. Don't present yourself as community champions whilst simultaneously implying you get to dictate what the community is and is not. Mike made a Rust logo that's rotated 90 degrees has a mirror R in it and the color is changed for his crate mirror-rust. Its a silly crate that does silly syntax things. Is he excommunicated from the community for multiple violations that you can't possibly enforce in other ways.Bye Mike (Mike does not exist. Mirror Rust®is a trademark of nobody because come on.) .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOTE: THIS IS Part 1 of 2 (word count limit). The second part is a comment replying to this comment."

Why is a political policy making its way into the trademark document? Also what happens if some US state passes a law saying that events can't ban firearms on the premises (there may already be such a law in certain cities?) would Rust events no longer be allowed in such locations? This seems an odd thing to include. Why not just state \"Rust events should follow local laws regarding the carrying of firearms\".\n\nAlso \"code of conduct\" requirements is inserting it's way into things here as well. Would it be banned to say have a \"Republicans for Rust\" event? This is the type of exclusionary language that I've long criticized being pushed by some parts of the Rust community. The Rust community is large, and should be maximally inclusive.\n\n> In general, we prohibit the modification of the Rust logo for any purpose, except to scale it. This includes distortion, transparency, color-changes affiliated with for-profit brands or political ideologies. \n\n> On the other hand, if you would like to change the colors of the Rust logo to communicate allegiance with a community movement, we simply ask that you run the proposed logo change by us by emailing the file to contact@rustfoundation.org with a description of the changes you’re proposing.\n\nWhat's the difference between a \"political ideology\" and a \"community movement\"? Movements are generally political in nature, by definition. From Google:\n\n> movement:\n\n> 3\\. a group of people working together to advance their shared political, social, or artistic ideas.\n\"the labor movement\"\n\nwith the first analogy being \"political group\". Who's going to define what's a \"political ideology\" and what's a \"community movement\"? Rust Foundation's lawyers? Political ideologies usually start as community movements, throughout history."

Am I wrong or we aren’t big enough to allow ourselves the burden of such petty corporate regulations?\n\nThere are already more than a few comparisons between Rust Foundation and Oracle but Rust isn’t Java and RF isn’t Oracle. By that I mean, Rust is an amazing language and I strongly believe that it has all chances to become one of the “big” languages, but we are not there yet. And Rust Foundation cannot get us there. The community can.\n\nI want to emphasise this last point — in the modern day and age, accessible tutorials, community-driven projects, community-managed info resources (e.g. Discords and etc.) are the only plausible way for a programming language to become a major part of the industry. Nothing else. Unless, of course, a corporate body has enough resources to lobby the tech, but I don’t think Rust Foundation is such a body.\n\nIt all reminds me of the recent D&D issue with OGL. People, as a collective, make things work. Stop damaging the communities.\n\nOne might argue that since the Policy draft was put up for community feedback, Rust Foundation are doing a good job. But that’s not true! Just look at all the other people angry about even the idea that someone can consider this to be a reasonable Policy. It’s still damaging, since people will start asking question whether all is fine with the Foundation or they live in some delusion where Rust is on a high enough level of adoption for them to start pulling stunts like this."

Even if we never actually owned it. Apparently it was trademarked before anyways. \n\nKinda like being evicted from your property if you don't pay taxes on it.  You thought you owned the property.  You didn't even have a loan (eg. you have the MIT / Apache License).  But the land belonged to your country you live in (Rust Foundation Trademark).

Local meetup groups (such as my own, Rust Bristol) very frequently do this and it's long been held that these groups do not have official foundation backing and are largely autonomous in their operation.\n\n> There are two possible outcomes to this situation if the policy as-given is to be upheld.\n\n> - The first outcome is that these groups would come under the wing of the foundation, resulting in untold administrative complexity and cost for the foundation (currently, most community groups are maintained by volunteer labour).\n\n> - The second outcome is that these groups simply die, an enormous and harmful constriction to the wider community and to the Rust project more broadly.\n\n> In conclusion, these restrictions are not simply awkward, but are in fact an active liability for the project and endanger the stability of the vast amount of voluntary work performed by the community that the Rust project (and, indeed, the foundation) benefit from today. I highly recommend that these policies are revised and work is done by the foundation to first garner much-lacking respect from the wider Rust community before it attempts to mandate how and when we use the symbols and language we've been using for years."

Or alternatively do kludgy things like wrapper each method and trait impl, or impl Deref and DerefMut for the newtype, which still doesn't cover all uses.\n\nIntuitively, one would like to just use `type mytype = basetype`.  Unfortunately such type aliases are not enforced by the compiler when used as fn parameters.  ie mytype and basetype are considered equivalent.\n\nWhat I would love to see is a keyword that has the same usage as 'type' but under the hood actually creates a real new type that is not equivalent to the basetype."

Currently it offloads the responsibility of most type-related checking to `cargo check`, which runs after saving by default.\n\nA while ago, r-a started implementing diagnostics for type mismatches in function calls and such.  So your editor lights up immediately as you type.  But these aren't enabled by default.  This change will bring more of those into the stable, enabled-by-default featureset.\n\nI have the following setup\n\n- Rust nightly / r-a nightly\n- Cranelift\n- macOS (26.0 beta)\n- Apple's new ld64 linker\n\nand it honestly feels like an entirely different experience than writing rust 2 years ago.  It's fast and responsive.  There's still a gap to TS and Go and such, but its closing rapidly, and the contributors and maintainers have moved the DX squarely into the \"whoa, this works really well\" zone.  Not to mention how hard this is with a language like Rust (traits, macros, lifetimes, are insanely hard to support)"

I personally expect the new trait solver to help with editing latencies *tremendously*, especially on larger, trait-heavy projects. Our extremely-tentative, not-to-be-cited benchmarks showed nearly a 3x speed improvement over Chalk and we haven’t even implemented any parallelism yet! Note that as of today, that speed improvement isn’t on nightly due to memory usage concerns, but we’ll get there.\n\nThe reason that autocomplete uses the trait solver so heavily is that to offer completions for trait-based methods, rust-analyzer needs to check whether the method receiver implements a given trait, even non-imported traits. Checking all traits for a given method receiver, even factoring in orphan rules (which gave us a 2x speed improvement when I implemented it about a year and a half ago!), is `O(crates)`."

Most of the stuff I work on is web applications, and I believe I am pretty good at it given my experience and interactions with my peers. I love programing and it takes up most of my free time.\n\nFor the past few months I have been learning Rust from the ground up. Its a fun and exciting language and there is plenty to learn. But there are parts of the language I don't understand because I have never worked with any systems language... and its at times dreadful. There are things I run into that I understand the functionality and maybe a use case. But I don't understand why the rules exist; furthermore, creating a small example of why the code behaves the way it does and why the feature needs to exist is difficult.\n\nFor example, the difference between `Rc` and `Arc` and what makes one thread safe and the other not. What is thread safety anyways? Atomics? What are those? What is memory ordering? and down the rabbit hole I go.\n\nOr things like how is Rust written in rust? LLVM? bootstrapping a compiler??? \n\nA simple exploration into one of rusts features has exploded into a ton of new information.\n\nIt has dawned on me that everything / or at least most of what I know about software development is based on abstractions. And I'm not talking about library abstractions, i mean language level ones.\n\nThere really isn't a super specific point to this post, It just makes me feel so bad I don't understand these things. I wish I could go back in time to earlier in my development career and work with things closer to the metal. Its really fascinating and I wish someone would have pushed me in the right direction when I was learning.\n\nI've been working with Rust for about 6 months in my free time and I can write safe single threaded rust pretty easily, but I have yet to do any deep dive on async / multi threaded applications. And everything surrounding unsafe rust seems like an entirely different monster.\n\nI want a deep understanding of how Rust works and its taking a lot longer then I expected.\n\nWhen I get to a comfortable place with Rust, I will probably go do some things that most other developers do in College... like writing on compiler, or learning machine code. I do have a BS but its in web development... Nothing low level was ever taught. It got me into the industry fast and I have a nice comfortable job, but I want to learn more."

May be a good first start :)\n* Regarding building a compiler there's a great book / guide you might find handy: [Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). As a good \"second read\" I can recommend *Language Implementation Patterns* by Parr and if you're also interested in seeing some bits from the historical side alongside the technical one, [Programming Language Pragmatics by Scott](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~scott/pragmatics/) is very fun and touches on many things. Also r/ProgrammingLanguages\n* You might enjoy playing something like \"turing complete\" for the \\*very\\* low level details (don't think \"it's just a game\" or smth. I originally trained in EE / CE and the game teaches a bunch of the stuff you'd encounter in classes from that domain :) People are implementing real ISAs in it and it even has VHDL export). If you want more formal info: imo the books by tanenbaum on computer archictecture and OSs are good; but I recently also heard good things about *Computer Systems: A Programmer's perspective* by Bryant and O'Hallaron.\n* For concurrency there's [a great book by mara bos called rust atomics and locks](https://marabos.nl/atomics/). For a softer intro: I think my first \"real\" intro to concurency was raymond hettingers talk on the topic (which you can find on youtube). It's focused on python but may still be worth a watch :)"

C and rust were primarily made for that stuff.\n\nAs for Arc/Rc, I would visit these concepts only after you learn about memory management and multithreading individually —> At a high level, the idea of reference counting, a cool and interesting way to manage heap allocated memory, also happens to solve a lot of issues with dealing with shared heap allocated memory across threads.\n\nfor the most part, having some kind of structured guidance in these topics will help a TON and you’ll have more confidence in terms of what you need to learn next"

He has no idea, so I started to tell him how programs run on top of an OS (I think). He insisted that's not how computers _really_ work, so I told him how there's a processor, memory, persistent storage etc. He _still_ said that's not how computers work; I told him that we could talk about transistors and stuff, but that won't help him understand computers either because _the important thing is to know there's abstractions and what they do, not how every single abstraction is implemented_.\n\nMy point is that there is absolutely nothing wrong with not encountering a lot of details until now. And now that you _want_ to look a few layers deeper, I don't think you will have big problems understanding them. It _does_ take time, but it's not magical and as long as you want to learn it, that motivation should keep you going.\n\nWithout structure, here are some additional thoughts I had regarding your post:\n- _\"But I don't understand why the rules exist\"_ - it can be valuable to also learn/use a language that lets you do stuff \"the wrong way\", e.g. Java or Python for concurrency or C for memory management. Reproducing the errors can help you understand the solutions better.\n- _\"everything surrounding unsafe rust seems like an entirely different monster\"_ - unsafe is no joke. If an unsafe function has safety requirements that I understand (e.g. it's \"just\" unsafe because FFI) I feel comfortable doing that, but more complex stuff I simply avoid. I haven't had the need for more complex unsafe anyway.\n- _\"like writing a compiler\"_ - as most people will probably tell you, [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) is a great entry point for that!"

Even having a surface level understanding of the language, I was able to create meaningful applications and take advantage of the language's numerous advantages.  Where language mastery helps is in efficiency - you can do a thing, or you can do a thing well. Either way, though, you're getting stuff done.  And, regardless of which language you're using this side of assembly (and even then, there's HLA assembly), abstraction is inevitable and essential, so there's no reason to feel bad that you're being kept back from the hardware by your choice of programming language.\n\nKnowing what you don't know is the most critical step in your path forward.  For me, async was one of those things that I didn't even try to understand until recently - I was doing just fine as you say with single-threaded apps with the occasional use of channels or rayon for certain operations.  My borrowing and lifetime chops were shaky for a good while, though putting my core data into an ECS forced me to grow that understanding very quickly.\n\nAnd what did a greater mastery of the language net me?  Better performance, lower memory consumption, and the ability to better understand and work with others' code.  And without those things, I still feel confident that my Rust code was more stable and performant than if I were trying to write the same code in C# or TS.  I'm positive my time in Rust was more profitable than if I had buckled down and put the same energy into C++ mastery."

You probably don't need to read it all, but the intro introduces many useful concepts and the chapters on cache management and coherence answer many of your questions about memory works at a system level. \n\nHowever, it's also critical to realize that Rust doesn't run on hardware. The code it generates does, sure, but there are massive degrees of freedom between Rust and the bare metal that the compiler exploits to optimize code. And that can lead to unexpected results if you're not careful about unsafe. \n\nThere's a series of posts from Ralf Jung that describes some of the unexpected outcomes possible with misuse of raw pointers. https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/07/24/pointers-and-bytes.html\n\nAll this is interesting and good stuff to know. The beauty of Rust though is that you can use safe Rust freely without knowing this stuff, secure in the knowledge that if it compiles, you won't run into these edge cases."

Enjoy it slowly, like how you enjoy eating! :)\n\nThat's my philosophy, anyway... \n\nAbout thread safety... I'm only now learning some details, so someone correct me if I'm wrong. Without it, it is possible for two threads to access the same piece of memory at the same time, and modify it at the same time. The final value of that piece of memory is whatever thread won that race, and modified that value last. To verify that that doesn't happen, you can use atomics, or you can use locks. Atomics verify that one thing happen one after the other by using some magic cpu calls, and it does it all without locking, which is real cool. Locks are an abstraction built on top of atomics and something called thread parking, and you can read more about it here: [https://marabos.nl/atomics/](https://marabos.nl/atomics/) Take the weekend to read through it... Go slowly... Enjoy! :)"

If you want to feel a little better, with the kind of programming you were doing, you were probably better off not knowing how computers work.\n\nIt's a bunch of extra knowledge, and it gnaws at you. Hey, is this abstraction \\*truely\\* thread safe? How do they implement it? How hard can I push this framework before it falls over? What's the failure type when it does? How should I change my monitoring strategy?\n\nImagine learning to drive, and not knowing the difference between pre-synchromesh transmissions, post-synchromesh manual, automatic, CVT. Each effect the power and reliability and cost of a car, and how you drive it... but most people don't know and don't think about it. They just drive, it's fine.\n\nMany of the folks I've worked with in your cohort are blissfully unaware - and were more successful and productive because of it.\n\nSystems peeps built those abstractions and worried hard so you didn't have to. It's ok.\n\nThat being said, welcome!"

      "text": "I've got a suggestion that comes from a different perspective than most of the excellent suggestions offered so far. It's based on an accidental advantage that I had thanks strange circumstances and gets you down into the most fundamental levels of computing quickly. It allows you discover and directly experience CPU registers, bit-wise operations, hardware interrupts, memory access and management, peripheral interfaces, etc in ways that are fairly quick and manageable.\n\nI suggest that, somewhere along the way sooner rather than later, it would be very useful for you to do a few straightforward projects that are engaging, purposeful, and focused on a simple hardware platform. The goal here is to have a few fairly abstraction-free experiences directly manipulating hardware. \n\nA super low-friction way of doing that is by getting a SoC- or microcontroller-based project that supports a language that you are already familiar with (most likely microPython or C, although there are others out there if you dig a bit). There are so many options that any hobby you already have could probably benefit, from building drones and bots to guitar pedals and synths, to home automation controllers, along with tons of other choices. If you want to really stretch, you could go with a FULL diy keyboard project where you'll end up implementing a custom firmware (search QMK for an interesting rabbit hole).\n\nMake the project first using the familiar language you've chosen. Once you've completed it, I recommend making it a second time in assembly. (This is why a simple 8-bit processor is a better choice than a more complex platform to start.) The are lots of options and kits that are STM32/ATmega/ESP-based (think Arduino/RPi etc that can be bought online).\n\nTaking this approach allows you to first get a clear idea of how the item \"should\" work using modern development tools, while introducing you steadily to processor and peripheral components in a modestly familiar way. You'll want to choose a project that includes programmatic elements as a core part of the activity otherwise you might end up learning more circuit design than CPU hardware insights lol.\n\nMore than anything else, choose something that sounds fun and will hold your interest while you grind thru the murkier parts. It will transform the way you look at systems languages like Rust/C/C++/etc."

Why not get rid of it completely? I’m currently also playing around with Rust and it doesn’t have null at all. So it seems to be possible to live without it.\n\n> I love this question. Why not get rid of null completely? This article is an expanded version of what I answered on that thread."

I recently wanted to make a lightweight clone of \\`neofetch\\` and I wanted to give it a try in Rust. The experience was really good. These are following things I loved coming from C++:\n\n1. The tooling is amazing. \\`cargo\\` is really good compared to \\`cmake\\` or other tools. I don't even think they're comparable that way but it felt good to use a good package manager + compiler. \\`rust-analyzer\\` for vscode felt like I was using an AI tool like copilot. It was genuinely faster to user \\`rust-analyzer\\` than to use copilot or other AI tools. Really showed how AI is nothing but fancy autocomplete for now and also how good tooling makes them redundant. The fact that the analyzer can work offline is a major plus.\n\n2. The library ecosystem and the accompanying documentation around it is amazing. Rust docs was amazing and having a consistent documentation source was a great plus.\n\n3. Writing Rust in the \"Rustonic\" (akin to Pythonic) way felt incredibly satisfying. I made a habit of first writing my code and then asking ChatGPT how I can write it in a Rustonic way and now I'm fairly comfortable following the rust idioms. It feels super satisfying and concise. I used to explore the C++ stl looking for some lesser known tricks and headers and it felt akin to that.\n\nI wrote a simple demo project to see how quickly I can come up something and I made a clone of \\`neofetch\\`. \n\nTry it out: \\`cargo install ashwin-fetch\\` (That's my name lol)"

      "text": "> Now, there are issue threads like this, in which 25 smart, well meaning people spent 2 years and over 200 comments trying to figure out how to improve Mutex. And as far as I can tell, in the end they more or less gave up.\n\nThe author of the linked comment did extensive analysis on the synchronization primitives in various languages, then rewrote Rust's synchronization primitives like Mutex and RwLock on every major OS to use the underlying operating system primitives directly (like futex on Linux), making them faster and smaller and all-around better, and in the process, literally *wrote a book* on parallel programming in Rust (which is useful for non-Rust parallel programming as well): https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/rust-atomics-and/9781098119430/\n\n> Features like Coroutines. This RFC is 7 years old now.\n\nWe haven't been idling around for 7 years (either on that feature or in general). We've added asynchronous functions (which whole ecosystems and frameworks have arisen around), traits that can include asynchronous functions (which required *extensive* work), and many other features that are both useful in their own right and needed to get to more complex things like generators. Some of these features are also critical for being able to standardize things like `AsyncWrite` and `AsyncRead`. And we now have an implementation of generators available in nightly.\n\n(There's some debate about whether we *want* the complexity of fully general coroutines, or if we want to stop at generators.)\n\nSome features have progressed slower than others; for instance, we still have a lot of discussion ongoing for how to design the AsyncIterator trait (sometimes also referred to as Stream). There have absolutely been features that stalled out. But there's a *lot* of active work going on.\n\nI always find it amusing to see, simultaneously, people complaining that the language isn't moving fast enough and other people complaining that the language is moving too fast.\n\n> Function traits (effects)\n\nWe had a *huge* design exploration of these quite recently, right before RustConf this year. There's a challenging balance here between usability (fully general effect systems are *complicated*) and power (not having to write multiple different versions of functions for combinations of async/try/etc). We're enthusiastic about shipping a solution in this area, though. I don't know if we'll end up shipping an *extensible* effect system, but I think we're very likely to ship a system that allows you to write e.g. one function accepting a closure that works for every combination of async, try, and possibly const.\n\n> Compile-time Capabilities\n\nSandboxing against *malicious* crates is an out-of-scope problem. You can't do this at the language level; you need some combination of a verifier and runtime sandbox. WebAssembly components are a much more likely solution here. But there's lots of interest in having capabilities for other reasons, for things like \"what allocator should I use\" or \"what async runtime should I use\" or \"can I assume the platform is 64-bit\" or similar. And we do want sandboxing of things like proc macros, not because of malice but to allow accurate caching that knows everything the proc macro depends on - with a sandbox, you know (for instance) exactly what files the proc macro read, so you can avoid re-running it if those files haven't changed.\n\n> Rust doesn't have syntax to mark a struct field as being in a borrowed state. And we can't express the lifetime of y.\n\n> Lets just extend the borrow checker and fix that!\n\n> I don't know what the ideal syntax would be, but I'm sure we can come up with something.\n\nThis has never been a problem of syntax. It's a *remarkably* hard problem to make the borrow checker able to handle self-referential structures. We've had a couple of iterations of the borrow checker, each of which made it capable of understanding more and more things. At this point, I *think* the experts in this area have ideas of *how* to make the borrow checker understand self-referential structures, but it's still going to take a substantial amount of effort.\n\n> This syntax could also be adapted to support partial borrows\n\nWe've known how to do partial borrows for quite a while, and we already support partial borrows in closure captures. The main blocker for supporting partial borrows in public APIs has been how to expose that to the type system in a forwards-compatible way that supports maintaining stable semantic versioning:\n\nIf you have a struct with private fields, how can you say \"this method and that method can borrow from the struct at the same time\" without exposing details that might break if you add a new private field?\n\nRight now, leading candidates include some idea of named \"borrow groups\", so that you can define your own subsets of your struct without exposing what private fields those correspond to, and so that you can change the fields as long as you don't change which combinations of methods can hold borrows at the same time.\n\n> Comptime\n\nWe're actively working on this in many different ways. It's not trivial, but there are many things we can and will do better here.\n\nI recently wrote two RFCs in this area, to make macro_rules more powerful so you don't need proc macros as often.\n\nAnd we're already talking about how to go even further and do more programmatic parsing using something closer to Rust constant evaluation. That's a *very* hard problem, though, particularly if you want the same flexibility of macro_rules that lets you write a macro and use it in the same crate. (Proc macros, by contrast, require you to write a separate crate, for a variety of reasons.)\n\n> `impl<T: Copy> for Range<T>`.\n\nThis is already in progress. This is tied to a backwards-incompatible change to the range types, so it can only occur over an edition. (It would be possible to do it without that, but having Range implement both Iterator and Copy leads to some easy programming mistakes.)\n\n> Make if-let expressions support logical AND\n\nWe have an unstable feature for this already, and we're close to stabilizing it. We need to settle which one or both of two related features we want to ship, but otherwise, this is ready to go.\n\n> But if I have a pointer, rust insists that I write `(*myptr).x` or, worse: `(*(*myptr).p).y`.\n\nWe've had multiple syntax proposals to improve this, including a postfix dereference operator and an operator to navigate from \"pointer to struct\" to \"pointer to field of that struct\". We don't currently have someone championing one of those proposals, but many of us are fairly enthusiastic about seeing one of them happen.\n\nThat said, there's also a danger of spending too much language weirdness budget here to buy more ergonomics, versus having people continue using the less ergonomic but more straightforward raw-pointer syntaxes we currently have. It's an open question whether adding more language surface area here would on balance be a win or a loss.\n\n> Unfortunately, most of these changes would be incompatible with existing rust.\n\nOne of the wonderful things about Rust editions is that there's very little we *can't* change, if we have a sufficiently compelling design that people will want to adopt over an edition."

I bet I could do better myself, but I don't have the time.\" Which strikes me as incredibly naive.\n\nStability is an _express feature of Rust_ that we're after. By design, we want Rust to be incredibly stable and backwards-compatible for years or decades to come. This is seen as an incredibly desirable feature to have by many industries. Rust has been stable for 8 years, and that's seen as *young* by many. Only _just now_ are some industries currently using C or C++ starting to become interested in adopting Rust. If we give it up now, it will only confirm to these parties that Rust indeed is \"a toy\" and not suitable for their industry.\n\nI do agree that there's an inherent tension between this kind of stability and innovation. Sometimes new features _do_ get discussed to death if there isn't a consensus on a cohesive vision on how the feature will be maintained and \"fit in\" with the rest of the language in the future. That's a bummer sometimes, but that's the price you pay for that kind of stability. There's a tradeoff, and if that tradeoff doesn't make sense for what you're doing, then Rust might not be the right language for you.\n\nI don't think this is a good or bad thing. Languages that do move fast and break things in order to adopt new innovative features have a place too. Oftentimes these sorts of languages are the ones on the frontlines turning research ideas into practical ones that later, move-slow-and-stable languages learn from and potentially borrow from. Think of it as Rust \"taking one for the team\" by being a stable language that still does take ideas from programming language research newer than 1995.\n\nThat said, I don't want to belittle the innovation that Rust _has_ had post-1.0, and I think in general Rust has done a pretty good job of adopting new large features in a backwards-compatible way that is also forwards-stable. It just won't be the same kind of progress that a move-fast language might have."

A few months ago, Mara Bos (IIRC) extended the compiler code for `format_args` to be able to pull those formats together (which improves performance in many cases). While this might be possible to implement as a proc macro, reaching the performance of the current code is a non-starter, and so while the motivation has changed, the macro is still implemented in the compiler.\n\nAlso I'm with you on `if let` chains. We use them in clippy and they're a big ux win. Per the [tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53667), the remaining open question is about interaction with `match`es. So we'll very likely get there within the next year.\n\nRegarding capabilities, there is the [Dacquiri](https://docs.rs/dacquiri/latest/dacquiri/) framework that already seems to do what you envision.\n\nI suggested having a write-only reference type back in 2016 that would have been safe to use (unlike `MaybeUninit`). Perhaps we'll get one in a future version of Rust, but I'm reasonably happy to have `MaybeUninit` in the meantime.\n\nRegarding purity, I have written an approximative condition check in clippy (originally for the `must_use_candidate` lint), which gave me an appreciation how hard it is to correctly implement such a thing and what corner cases a correct check would have to handle (e.g. would cloning an `Arc` constitute a side effect? Technically it is, because it could overflow the refcount, but that's highly unlikely and probably not too helpful)."

They also describe frustration/disappointment that the language isn't still adding features as quickly as it once did, and offer an hypothesis that the *management* of the Rust language isn't scaling well (which leads to slower feature development).\n\nI *do* actually feel like Rust is a first-gen \"product\" akin to the first iPhone. I really like that comparison and it resonates with me. It's not an *insult*- it's actually pretty high praise. However, I *don't* feel that way because of the cadence of features being added to Rust. I honestly don't really want Rust to be this giant kitchen-sink of a language that supports every single trendy programming feature natively.\n\nThe reason I think Rust feels like a first-gen product is because its fundamental innovation (lifetimes and borrow checking) was so novel that it was hard to guess what patterns programmers would discover and to design APIs (because you can't just ~~steal~~ *be inspired by* some other language's approach without adapting it to make sense with Rust). Some APIs didn't age especially well (deprecated Error stuff, mutex poisoning is *mostly* considered to be a mistake by many, etc).\n\nAnother reason it feels like a gen1 product is that the Rust team made the pragmatic decision to stabilize features before they were truly 100% complete (the \"minimum viable product\", a.k.a. MVP, approach). But, by doing so, you can often find that different language features don't always work together, and it makes Rust feel either incomplete and/or experimental--like they're just trying out stuff and hoping it'll eventually work. This is most obvious with features like `impl Trait` in return position and `async fn` taking a very long time to work with trait methods (and AFAIK, they **still** aren't 100% complete). It makes the language feel inconsistent and very \"rough around the edges\".\n\nRust is awesome, but I definitely think it's the iPhone 1 of its programming language niche/generation. I think and hope that whatever ends up being Rust 2.0 has a more cohesive vision and design from the get-go so that everything in the language works with everything else and *feels* consistent and purposeful. But, *if* there ever is a language that is the second generation standard bearer, I have no doubt that it wouldn't be possible without Rust coming first and going through its growing pains. That's just the price of real innovation."

It should be expected that a dynamic work-stealing scheduler will be out-performed by a well-balanced static schedule because there's some inherent overhead and no upside (and I think NPB is all regular applications?). The bump you see from hyper-threading is essentially just imbalancing the schedule by making the hardware heterogeneous.\n\nI think you should make an effort to include apples to apples comparisons. Cilk/Intel TBB are some mature work-stealing schedulers in C++. In Rust, I think the best comparison to omp parallel-for would be manual threading?"

It seems to me you can start with Rust, and for all not-yet implemented code, you can call SQLite or libSQL code, already tested. It seem pointless to have any unsafe Rust code, since you might have the already tested C code. Knowing fully memory-save would mean dropping all those, for fewer features.\n\n  \nAre there any any tools to convert C to Rust, for at least \"unsafe\" Rust code? That might also do. It seems such code wouldn't be any better (or worse) Rust code than C, but a steppingstone to then make it safe Rust code. I doubt any converter manages to make safe Rust code?!"
